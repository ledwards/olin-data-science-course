It was matured for 12 months with 28% new oak. It has a lovely bouquet, very pure and quite minerally, lifted Morello and strawberry fruit that is very detailed and utterly charming. The palate is medium-bodied fine and supple tannin, a keen line of acidity, balanced with fresh brambly red fruit and my only quibble is that it cuts away abruptly on the finish, hurrying out the door as if it has somewhere else to go. Even though it does not have the persistence, it is still a commendable Pinot Noir, one that I would prefer to drink in its youth rather than cellar.""]","$43.75","no data, see reviews","no data, see reviews","no data","no data","no data, see structure","no data, see scores","combined with secondary","no data, see reviews","no data, see flavor","no data, see flavor","no data, see flavor","no data, cellar-tracker?","no data, see reviews","no data, see reviews","no data, see reviews","medium","no data, see reviews","no data, see professional reviews"
