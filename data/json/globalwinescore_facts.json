Nearly a mirror image of the La Chapelle, just with more going on, the Ausone boasts a more saturated purple color, and the wine has everything in large, intense proportions. The finesse and delicacy of all its components are what make it such a remarkable wine.

Breathtakingly wide spectrum of floral honey, exotic fruit (passion fruit, mango and pineapple), caramel and marzipan aromas. But none of this is a jot too much.

Very suave and sensual finish that goes on and on. Drink or hold.","Containing 135 grams per liter of residual sugar, the pale lemon-gold colored 2016 d'Yquem leaps from the glass with honeyed apricots, pineapple, green mango, crushed rocks, candied ginger, coriander seed and citrus peel with hints of orange blossom. The palate is very tightly wound, vibrant and refreshing with layer upon layer of minerals and spices, finishing with epic poise and persistence.\n\nRating: 98+","The bouquet opens with aromas of honey and citrus, offering richness and freshness at the same time. The mouthfeel is opulent, with honeyed flavors. There is some acidity underneath, although decadence and concentration are its defining attributes. It will age for decades.Barrel Sample: 95-97","This is exotic, with very lush and seductive notes of coconut, honeysuckle, creamed white peach, glazed pear, mirabelle plum and yellow apple, all woven together seamlessly.

From a cooler year and possessing bright acidity, full-bodied richness and building tannin, it offers up a smorgasbord of cured meats, licorice, dried flowers, spice and sweet berry fruit. Drinking nicely now, it should continue to evolve gracefully for another two decades.","Remarkable effort in the '99 vintage. Beautiful. Inky-black and very intense, built in a modern style, like a top Bordeaux classified-growth, with plenty of freshly crushed berries, cigar box, citrus, roasted chestnuts, tobacco and jammy plum to provide much pleasure.

Full-bodied with great, tight fruit. This is subtle and complex, then it opens on the palate and shows incredible depth and intensity. Great length, going on and on for minutes.\nBarrel Sample: 99-100","Compared to the La Mission Haut-Brion, the 2019 Château Haut-Brion is more backward and mineral-laced, with a dense purple color as well as notes of blueberry liqueur, black cherries, new leather, scorched earth, graphite, camphor, liquid rock-like minerality, and an almost Hermitage-like burning embers character. It doesn't have the overt power of Mouton, nor the sexiness of Château Margaux, yet it builds slowly and incrementally, with flawless balance, full-bodied richness, ultra-fine tannins, and a magical finish. My money is on this being one of the all-time greats from this address, in the same league as the 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016, and 2018. It will need a solid decade of cellaring and have 40-50+ years of prime drinking.Barrel Sample: 98-100","The 2019 Haut-Brion is a blend of 48.7% Merlot, 43.2% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8.1% Cabernet Franc, harvested from the 10th of September to the 3rd of October. The estimated label alcohol degree is 14.5%. Displaying a deep garnet-purple color, it comes off incredibly shy and reticent to begin, needing considerable coaxing to reveal notes of dark chocolate-covered cherries, blackberry preserves, woodsmoke and sandalwood, before launching into a full-scale fireworks display of iron ore, cumin seed, redcurrant jelly, red roses, oolong tea and Sichuan pepper scents plus a waft of cardamom. The medium to full-bodied palate delivers the most exquisitely ripe, finely grained tannins with a lively backbone of freshness supporting the tightly wound, earth-laced black fruit layers, finishing very long and minerally. This is one of the most finely structured, tightly knit wines of the vintage. Given time, I wouldn't be at all surprised if it goes atomic and eventually takes top place for the vintage. Barrel Sample: (97-99)+","The 2019 Haut-Brion is completely different to La Mission Haut-Brion, the two compared side-by-side in the course of 24 hours. It was picked from 10 September until 3 October at 53hl/ha. Initially it is riper, more extrovert and luxurious than its sibling, yet returning after four hours (when chatting to Jean-Philippe Delmas) it has transmogrified into a very different wine with intense black fruit, boysenberry, iodine, forest floor and potpourri. The palate is medium-bodied and like the nose, initially comes across quite exuberant. Four hours later it is a much more nuanced wine that begins in understated fashion before a crescendo of black fruit tinged with blood orange and Chinese 5-spice. It fans out and gains volume wonderfully on the finish. This is a sensual and almost flamboyant Haut-Brion. - Neal MartinBarrel Sample: 96-98","Powerful and confident, there is no mistaking this concentration of ripe damson and black cherry fruits, set against coffee, earth, sage and black chocolate. Tons of tannins on display but extremely fine, to the point that you almost don't notice them, then once the wine has left your mouth you suddenly realise how many there are, and how they are still exerting a pressure. Great persistency, slowing everything down and asking you to stop and think. Clear ageing ability here.

Full-bodied with great, tight fruit. This is subtle and complex, then it opens on the palate and shows incredible depth and intensity. Great length, going on and on for minutes.\nBarrel Sample: 99-100","Compared to the La Mission Haut-Brion, the 2019 Château Haut-Brion is more backward and mineral-laced, with a dense purple color as well as notes of blueberry liqueur, black cherries, new leather, scorched earth, graphite, camphor, liquid rock-like minerality, and an almost Hermitage-like burning embers character. It doesn't have the overt power of Mouton, nor the sexiness of Château Margaux, yet it builds slowly and incrementally, with flawless balance, full-bodied richness, ultra-fine tannins, and a magical finish. My money is on this being one of the all-time greats from this address, in the same league as the 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016, and 2018. It will need a solid decade of cellaring and have 40-50+ years of prime drinking.Barrel Sample: 98-100","The 2019 Haut-Brion is a blend of 48.7% Merlot, 43.2% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8.1% Cabernet Franc, harvested from the 10th of September to the 3rd of October. The estimated label alcohol degree is 14.5%. Displaying a deep garnet-purple color, it comes off incredibly shy and reticent to begin, needing considerable coaxing to reveal notes of dark chocolate-covered cherries, blackberry preserves, woodsmoke and sandalwood, before launching into a full-scale fireworks display of iron ore, cumin seed, redcurrant jelly, red roses, oolong tea and Sichuan pepper scents plus a waft of cardamom. The medium to full-bodied palate delivers the most exquisitely ripe, finely grained tannins with a lively backbone of freshness supporting the tightly wound, earth-laced black fruit layers, finishing very long and minerally. This is one of the most finely structured, tightly knit wines of the vintage. Given time, I wouldn't be at all surprised if it goes atomic and eventually takes top place for the vintage. Barrel Sample: (97-99)+","The 2019 Haut-Brion is completely different to La Mission Haut-Brion, the two compared side-by-side in the course of 24 hours. It was picked from 10 September until 3 October at 53hl/ha. Initially it is riper, more extrovert and luxurious than its sibling, yet returning after four hours (when chatting to Jean-Philippe Delmas) it has transmogrified into a very different wine with intense black fruit, boysenberry, iodine, forest floor and potpourri. The palate is medium-bodied and like the nose, initially comes across quite exuberant. Four hours later it is a much more nuanced wine that begins in understated fashion before a crescendo of black fruit tinged with blood orange and Chinese 5-spice. It fans out and gains volume wonderfully on the finish. This is a sensual and almost flamboyant Haut-Brion. - Neal MartinBarrel Sample: 96-98","Powerful and confident, there is no mistaking this concentration of ripe damson and black cherry fruits, set against coffee, earth, sage and black chocolate. Tons of tannins on display but extremely fine, to the point that you almost don't notice them, then once the wine has left your mouth you suddenly realise how many there are, and how they are still exerting a pressure. Great persistency, slowing everything down and asking you to stop and think. Clear ageing ability here.

Full-bodied, tight and tannic with a muscular and toned texture that holds the wine down at the moment, but it’s waiting to release its joy and true nature. Fine-grained. Give it until 2023.","Medium-bodied, fresh attack, dominated by late summer fruits, suggesting perfectly but not overly ripe, still great integrity to the fruit, a floating gossamer quality to the structure, the tannins are deceptively fine, they in fact hold the structure very tightly, feel it on the finish with its impression of blackberry and raspberry fruits being kept firmly in hold. A lovely wine, medium to long term but with great potential for pleasure.","Richly endowed, the wine is beautifully concentrated. Still young it has considerable potential with its rich fruits and firm tannins. There is a strongly juicy aftertaste that brings in the freshness of the year. The wine will age well, and should not be drunk before 2026.","The 2014 La Mission Haut Brion is a blend of 54% Merlot, 1% Cabernet Franc and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, picked between 15 September and 8 October and raised in 55% new oak. It has retained that engagingly fresh and vibrant bouquet, the bashful nature that it showed in barrel replaced by a more outgoing personality. This is an exquisite bouquet with pure black fruit, cold stone, a touch of black olive and later a suggestion of boysenberry preserve. The palate is still structured and considering that a majority is Merlot, quite masculine. There remains some new oak to be fully assimilated, although there is clearly the fruit to soak that up. It comes more alive on the second half with a lovely spiciness and impressive persistence. It will have more to give down the line and the strictness implies that this La Mission Haut Brion should be afforded a decade in the cellar before it will show what it can do.","The 2014 Château La Mission Haut Brion is slightly more elegant and pretty compared to the richer, slightly more masculine Haut Brion. A blend of 54% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and a splash of Cabernet Franc, it shows a kiss of red fruits in its core of darker currants, smoke tobacco, scorched earth, vanilla bean, and spice-driven aromas and flavors. With medium to full-bodied richness, impeccable balance, fine tannin, and a great, great finish, it’s a downright classy La Mission that will benefit from 4-5 years of bottle age and keep for 20+.","Fleshy and very compact, with layers of dark fig, black currant paste and blackberry reduction still sorting themselves out. Sports a serious spine of tar while a well-roasted apple wood element forms the backdrop on the dense finish. The range and density set this apart. Should be rather long-lived for the vintage.

Medium-bodied, the palate is at once ethereally graceful and powerfully intense, featuring layer upon layer of profound smoky, savory flavors and decadently ripe fruit, framed by exquisite, silt-like tannins and just enough freshness, finishing with epic length. In terms of flavor profile, this is a surprisingly (atypically) hedonic, forward expression, with notably lower acidity/higher pH (the pH is 3.9). The alcohol is 13.4%, just a tick higher than the 2018 (13.3%).

You're getting sapidity and savoury black fruits that are both elegant and full of power. The spicy rosemary and black pepper, with slate-textured minerality, is almost unnoticeable until it closes in on the final stretch, helping to stretch things out, beat by beat, adding energy and lift. One half of the 5% Merlot in this blend is from plots that have never before been used in Lafite's 1st wine, because their drone and satellite research discovered three tiny areas that were similar in character and could be vinified together. They have worked on this for the past three years, successfully so for first time in 2019. It just holds on tight, with a creaminess that you don't always find in Lafite at this early stage. A brilliant wine, one that could be upscored from this when in bottle. \nBarrel Sample: 98","The 2019 Lafite-Rothschild was picked from 19 September with the Merlots, pausing during a rainy spell and then picked through to 7 October. The blend includes what Eric Kohler calls \"outsider\" parcels that met the grade, including some of the Merlot on more clayey soils (see introduction) as well as 13.5% vin de presse. Alcohol here is some half a degree lower than many of its peers at around 13.4%. It has a very sensual bouquet, not a common feature in this First Growth, with generous black fruit infused with pencil box, sous-bois and discrete white pepper aromas. The oak is beautifully subsumed by the fruit already. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent, rounded tannins that lend this Lafite its creamy femme fatale texture and disguise its backbone. More powerful than expected, this builds in the mouth towards an atypically corpulent, dense finish that seems to \"flow\" across the senses. There is not a single hair out of place. I can envisage this firming up during its élevage and deserving more bottle age than seemingly appropriate at this juncture.

There is plenty of fruit on the nose—more than I have encountered on previous bottles, with a mixture of red and black fruit—and a hint of bell pepper and sage. The main difference is that those previously rigid tannin have loosened their collar in recent months; therefore, this Lafleur is now entertaining the notion of drinkability. There remains a linearity to this Lafleur—and there is still that backbone—yet it seems to flow nicely across the mouth, and there is superb mineralité on the finish. It's probably destined to be overshadowed by the succeeding two vintages, but I suggest you do not overlook the 2008 Lafleur.","A bright, fresh, very pure style, with raspberry and bitter cherry fruit flavors laced with judicious toast and a streak of red licorice.

Crushed violet, rich and silky, lush texture with very refined and complex fragrance. Ultimate purity with dense and ripe tannins, some dryness.

There is plenty of fruit on the nose—more than I have encountered on previous bottles, with a mixture of red and black fruit—and a hint of bell pepper and sage. The main difference is that those previously rigid tannin have loosened their collar in recent months; therefore, this Lafleur is now entertaining the notion of drinkability. There remains a linearity to this Lafleur—and there is still that backbone—yet it seems to flow nicely across the mouth, and there is superb mineralité on the finish. It's probably destined to be overshadowed by the succeeding two vintages, but I suggest you do not overlook the 2008 Lafleur.","A bright, fresh, very pure style, with raspberry and bitter cherry fruit flavors laced with judicious toast and a streak of red licorice.

Grown at a 116-acre vineyard at the southern border of Pauillac, some of the vines now reaching 100 years of age on a gravel bar overlooking the Gironde, Latour harvests cabernet sauvignon with natural power. I could describe it as colors, from glistening ruby to purple-black then back to scarlet tannins that vibrate in red. Or just the pure, unadulterated flavor of black currant, unformed as a child is unformed, beautiful as a child is beautiful. However I might describe it, the wine is stronger than I am and will outlast me by decades.

Brilliant, intense aromas of mineral, blackberry and currant, with hints of Indian spices and cigar box, lead to a full-bodied palate, with ultrafine tannins and a beautiful balance of blackberry, raspberry and mineral.

The extraordinary seductiveness, complex aromatics, and purity it exhibits lead me to believe it has reached its window of full maturity. Medium-bodied, with layers of concentration, stunning blue, red, and black fruits intermixed with spring flowers, a subtle dosage of new oak, and a distinctive personality that is elegant while at the same time powerful and substantial, this is a multi-dimensional wine that was extremely approachable and drinkable in both tastings I had of it. The color remains a healthy, even opaque bluish/purple, but there is no reason to hesitate to drink it. It should evolve for another 30-40 years, so there is no hurry either.","This is like smelling an amazing bouquet of flowers, deep and thought provoking. Notes of raspberries, and strawberries round out the refined nose. Full and silky. More than just silk really, it is almost transparent. Incredibly mellow, yet enticing. It is difficult to find the perfect word. It is as ethereal as Paul Pontieller, managing director of Chateaux Margaux says. The impeccable balance makes this perfect to drink now, but it will get even better with more time. This is already ageless.","This has jaw-dropping notes of Lapsang souchong tea, warmed fig, black currant confiture and anise-infused plum sauce, both aromatically and on the palate.

It’s a warming, piquant sip marked by clove, cardamom and black pepper, but balanced freshly too. Tannins are fine and feathery. Oak tones are a bit flashy in youth but should meld beautifully through 2031.","Deep brilliant violet. Intensely perfumed aromas of ripe cherry, blackberry, candied violet, spicecake, garrigue and exotic spices, along with a smoky mineral overtone that builds in the glass. Stains the palate with deeply concentrated red and dark berry liqueur, fruitcake, licorice pastille and lavender flavors that possess a compelling blend of richness and energy. The mineral note comes back strong on a strikingly long, penetrating finish shaped by velvety, steadily mounting tannins. This is the best example of this venerable domaine's work that I can recall drinking in its infancy, and it may measure up to their legendary 1959 and 1961 bottlings, which I first tried back in the late 1980s.","Showing similar to last year, the 2016 Châteauneuf Du Pape offers a classic bouquet of black raspberries, garrigue, and spice box, with a touch of minerality. It’s more rounded, fleshy, and layered than the more concentrated 2017, has plenty of upfront appeal, and will keep for 15+ years.","Intense raspberry and black currant compote notes form the core, which is dense in feel, with melted licorice, singed anise and warm fruitcake flavors filling in around the fruit. A solid, racy graphite edge supports all the elements through the long, grippy finish.

This beauty hits the palate with an incredible display of opulent, decent fruit paired with an elegance and seamlessness that needs to be tasted to be believed. With building richness, no weight, ultra-fine tannins, and a finish that won’t quit, it’s released only in magnum, so it will take upward of a decade to hit maturity and will keep for 20+ years. Hats off to the Maurel family and their consultant Philippe Cambie!","Bottled only in magnum, the 2016 Chateauneuf du Pape Sanctus Sanctorum, made entirely from Grenache planted in 1905, was aged in new demi-muids, yet it has completely absorbed any trace of barrel. Incredibly intense and dramatic, it combines savory notes of licorice and dark roses with black cherries and dried spices.

The palate has perfect acidity and subtle spicy notes on the entry: hints of lime flower, citrus lemon and a subtle note of mandarin coming through with aeration. Is exhibits balletic poise on the finish – a sensational Corton-Charlemagne that just may turn out to be just as good as the 2010. Drink 2018-2035.","Unlike the Rougeots and Genevrières here the nose displays no reduction which allows the elegant, ripe and beautifully layered and mildly toasty aromas of mandarin orange, peach, white flowers, apple, anise and wet stone to shine. There is excellent concentration to the broad-shouldered and moderately powerful flavors that possess a caressing mouth feel on the mid-palate yet the hugely long and pungently stony finish is borderline painfully intense. I was actually quite surprised at how much better this was than the Genevrières as there was just an entire other dimension of depth and length.

Coming from the La Janasse and La Crau lieux-dits and brought up in foudre, its deep purple color is followed by blockbuster notes of crème de cassis, blackberries, chocolate, graphite, and earthy, rocky, mineral-like nuances. It's deep and full-bodied, with a ripe, powerful yet balanced style and a great finish. A classic example of this cuvée. it's going to benefit from short-term cellaring and keep for two decades or more.","The 2017 Chateauneuf du Pape Cuvee Vieilles Vignes derives from parcels planted on classic clay and galets roulés soils. It's 65% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre, 10% Syrah and 5% other varieties. Tight, intense, even clenched, it's in need of several years' cellaring before it becomes truly enjoyable to drink. For now, those gorgeous black cherries are restrained behind a firm wall of tannins. Full-bodied and rich, this is ripe, it just requires patience.","There’s less grenache here in 2017 (60%); the balance is made up of syrah and mourvedre, all from 80 to 100 years of age. The richness and depth here is really impressive, as is the freshness of ripe berries and a dark and quite dense, plum and black-cherry burst at the finish. The palate has a very supple, succulent and juicy feel. Some firmness to the tannins and good drive with a silky edge. Try from 2024.","Ripe and fresh, with an engaging beam of cassis, dark plum and boysenberry puree flavors, supported by light anise, graphite and sweet tobacco notes.

This is also imposingly scaled with its full-bodied and overtly powerful mouth coating flavors that deliver almost painful intensity and power on the dramatically long finish. Once again this is a big but impeccably well-balanced effort that should amply repay extended keeping. A 'wow' wine. Barrel Sample: 94-96","The 2015 Montrachet Grand Cru amounts to a demi-muid and two barrels this year, which might not sound like much, but it's a damn lot more than the 170 kilograms eked from the 2016 vintage and due to be blended with five other equally bereft growers. This vintage has a very engaging nose: honeysuckle and jasmine, flint and a distant scent of pralines all veiled in a pleasant reduction (which seems to be Dominique Lafon's intention in recent vintages). Naturally, the palate is extremely well balanced and there is a fine bead of acidity. Its core of citrus fruit is complemented by brioche and praline, and dovetails into a light tropical vein towards the weighty (but not heavy) finish. Whilst it will doubtless be a long-term proposition, unlike the 2014 I can envisage this being broached with just 2-3 years in bottle.

As always, this beauty is 100% Merlot that was brought up in 50% new wood in 2015. A wine that opens up beautifully with time in the glass, it has beautiful mid-palate depth, sweet, sweet tannins, and voluptuous yet weightless texture that needs to be tasted to be believed.

Medium to full-bodied, it fills the palate with generous, exuberant, wonderfully layered red, black and perfumed blue fruits contrasted beautifully by very ripe, very fine-grained and very firm tannins plus an ethereal line of seamless acid, finishing long and minerally. Olivier Berrouet and his team have knocked it out of the park in 2015. Look for this Pétrus to build and unfold over the next 20 years and confidently cellar this legend for 40+ years.","This is like drinking liquid black currants and blackberries.

Drink from 2026.\n\nCellar Selection","The aromas to this are a reference for Pomerol with truffles, black olives, black licorice and dark fruit. Even brown sugar. Full-bodied, layered and multi-dimensional. Chocolate underlines the character above. The perfect tannin texture, length and balance make you think you're dreaming. All about harmony and beauty. Love to taste it now but needs at least five or six years.","There is so much going on with Petrus in 2015 that you should just pull up a chair and relax, don't expect to be going anywhere soon. Aromatic persistency keeps reaching in, pulling you further alongside. There is a soft quality to the tannins that allows the black fruit to be both juicy and sweet. High alcohol is balanced by freshness - a pH of 3.5 is relatively rare on these sticky clay soils - unleashing waves of flavour, including bergamot, smoky tea, black olives and rich cherry. The persistency is crazy - I had to get my notes back out two or three times to take down additional flavours because it just kept giving something more. And it makes you smile!

As always, this beauty is 100% Merlot that was brought up in 50% new wood in 2015. A wine that opens up beautifully with time in the glass, it has beautiful mid-palate depth, sweet, sweet tannins, and voluptuous yet weightless texture that needs to be tasted to be believed. Hide bottles for 4-5 years, count yourself lucky, and enjoy over the following 3-4 decades.","Reserved right now, but there is a well of blackberry, boysenberry and plum coulis flavors in reserve here, infused with black tea, anise and singed spice elements.

Medium to full-bodied, it fills the palate with generous, exuberant, wonderfully layered red, black and perfumed blue fruits contrasted beautifully by very ripe, very fine-grained and very firm tannins plus an ethereal line of seamless acid, finishing long and minerally. Olivier Berrouet and his team have knocked it out of the park in 2015. Look for this Pétrus to build and unfold over the next 20 years and confidently cellar this legend for 40+ years.","This is like drinking liquid black currants and blackberries. The wine has great intensity and richness from the superbly generous Merlot. The wood aging is still there as a hint in the background although the fruit and acidity dominate. Drink from 2026.\n\nCellar Selection","The aromas to this are a reference for Pomerol with truffles, black olives, black licorice and dark fruit. Even brown sugar. Full-bodied, layered and multi-dimensional. Chocolate underlines the character above. The perfect tannin texture, length and balance make you think you're dreaming. All about harmony and beauty. Love to taste it now but needs at least five or six years.","There is so much going on with Petrus in 2015 that you should just pull up a chair and relax, don't expect to be going anywhere soon. Aromatic persistency keeps reaching in, pulling you further alongside. There is a soft quality to the tannins that allows the black fruit to be both juicy and sweet. High alcohol is balanced by freshness - a pH of 3.5 is relatively rare on these sticky clay soils - unleashing waves of flavour, including bergamot, smoky tea, black olives and rich cherry. The persistency is crazy - I had to get my notes back out two or three times to take down additional flavours because it just kept giving something more. And it makes you smile! What more do you want? Bottled in June, but will not be sent out to customers until April 2018. 50% new oak.","The 2015 Petrus is undoubtedly one of the gems in the vintage and will probably merit a perfect score in another decade. Even so, it has the sexy, exotic nature of the vintage front and center and offers a huge perfume of black currants, kirsch liqueur, Asian spices, and incense. As always, this beauty is 100% Merlot that was brought up in 50% new wood in 2015. A wine that opens up beautifully with time in the glass, it has beautiful mid-palate depth, sweet, sweet tannins, and voluptuous yet weightless texture that needs to be tasted to be believed. Hide bottles for 4-5 years, count yourself lucky, and enjoy over the following 3-4 decades.","Reserved right now, but there is a well of blackberry, boysenberry and plum coulis flavors in reserve here, infused with black tea, anise and singed spice elements. Remarkably silky, elegant and extremely long, this unfurls ever so slowly in the glass, beguiling with texture and fruit purity.

Best from 2022 and for at least a decade after that.","The 2016 Syrah Bionic Frog needs no introduction, as its reputation proceeds it. Aromas of black fruit, olive and savory herbs with hints of mustard seed waft from the nose.

An instant success, only 509 cases were created.","The aromas fascinate, with notes of funk, earth, savory green olive, herb, soot, umami, black pepper, black olive brine, smoked meat and caper.

It has a similar level of purity, as well as incredible minerality, to go with notes of crème de cassis, scorched earth, crushed rock, and graphite. Reminiscent of liking a rock with its insane level of minerality, this full-bodied beauty is tight and closed on the palate, yet is just loaded with potential. It’s only for those with cold cellars and needs forgotten for 7-8 years, but will keep for 4-5 decades. Bravo!","A blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Petit Verdot and 8% Malbec, the deep garnet-purple colored 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon Pritchard Hill has gone a little reticent at this stage, offering quiet notions of blackberry pie and blueberry tart with sparks of dried herbs, earth and savory/meaty suggestions. Full-bodied, rich and concentrated with a built-like-a-brick-house structure framing the massive fruit, it finishes long with exotic spices coming through.","Blackcurrants and black olives with hints of currants and basil.

White truffle, mint, bitter chocolate and cloves melt into a rich, layered core of blue and black fruit. Hints of tar, smoke, mocha and grilled herbs develop later, adding further complexity and nuance. Layers of fruit continue to build to a head-spinning crescendo of aromas and flavors. I can’t say enough about the job the entire team at Dana Estates has done with this utterly magnificent Cabernet Sauvignon. The Lotus was fermented in a combination of 45% oak uprights, 45% cement and 10% barrique. It spent 26 months in 100% new French oak barrels. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2030.","The 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon Lotus Vineyard from the Napa Valley is a brilliant effort that flirts with perfection (much like the 2007).

I can’t say enough about the job the entire team at Dana Estates has done with this utterly magnificent Cabernet Sauvignon. The Lotus was fermented in a combination of 45% oak uprights, 45% cement and 10% barrique. It spent 26 months in 100% new French oak barrels.

The palate is medium to full-bodied with a densely packed mid-palate and oodles of freshness framed by very ripe, finely grained tannins and laced with compelling earthy accents. It offers incredible vibrancy with tons of black and red fruit sparkle in the mid-palate leading to a provocative mineral element on the very long finish. If I could give more than 100 for this one, I would. To be released in May 2019.","Another possible legend in the making is the 2016 Dominus, a classic blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Petit Verdot and the rest Cabernet Franc brought up in 40% new French oak. Pure, pristine notes of charcoal, cold fireplace, smoke tobacco, and both blue and black fruits all flow to a full-bodied 2016 that has incredible elegance and finesse, yet also depth and density. It’s more backward and reserved than the 2015 and needs 4-5 years of cellaring. It will unquestionably live for 25-30 years. Rating: 98+","The opulence of fresh flowers and dark fruit is so impressive. There’s so much going on, from flowers to currants. The palate is full and powerful, but what impresses most are the ripe tannins and the amazing poise at the finish. Tightens down at the end. A blend of 84 per cent cabernet sauvignon, eight per cent petit verdot and eight per cent cabernet franc. Drink in 2021.","The 2016 Dominus is a dark, somber wine. I don't quite see the explosive energy of the 2013 or 2010, not the seductiveness of the 2012, but the 2016 has a distinct charm that is all its own. Quite frankly, I can't remember a young Dominus with this combination of fruit density, freshness and polished tannins. A huge center of fruit emerge with time in the glass in a big, large-scaled Dominus that should provide readers with a long drinking window of pure pleasure once some of the baby fat wears off.","This marries a range of old-school savory, tobacco, chestnut and bay leaf notes with a dense and muscular core of dark currant and blackberry fruit, all backed by a loam-swaddled finish. Long and dense, but defined, with the fruit steadily emerging to win out in the end. Patience is required.

Sumptuous tannins ","flavors":["blackberries","blueberries","smoke","tobacco"]}],"professionalReviews":["A blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Petit Verdot and 8% Cabernet Franc aged in 40% new oak, the 2016 Proprietary Red Wine is deep purple-black in color and quite reticent at this youthful stage to begin, offering up subtle notions of potpourri, Indian spices, cigar box and iron ore over a core of crushed blackberries and black cherries with intermittent wafts of black and red currants, new leather and smoked meats. The palate is medium to full-bodied with a densely packed mid-palate and oodles of freshness framed by very ripe, finely grained tannins and laced with compelling earthy accents. It offers incredible vibrancy with tons of black and red fruit sparkle in the mid-palate leading to a provocative mineral element on the very long finish. If I could give more than 100 for this one, I would. To be released in May 2019.","Another possible legend in the making is the 2016 Dominus, a classic blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Petit Verdot and the rest Cabernet Franc brought up in 40% new French oak. Pure, pristine notes of charcoal, cold fireplace, smoke tobacco, and both blue and black fruits all flow to a full-bodied 2016 that has incredible elegance and finesse, yet also depth and density. It’s more backward and reserved than the 2015 and needs 4-5 years of cellaring. It will unquestionably live for 25-30 years. Rating: 98+","The opulence of fresh flowers and dark fruit is so impressive. There’s so much going on, from flowers to currants. The palate is full and powerful, but what impresses most are the ripe tannins and the amazing poise at the finish. Tightens down at the end. A blend of 84 per cent cabernet sauvignon, eight per cent petit verdot and eight per cent cabernet franc. Drink in 2021.","The 2016 Dominus is a dark, somber wine. I don't quite see the explosive energy of the 2013 or 2010, not the seductiveness of the 2012, but the 2016 has a distinct charm that is all its own. Quite frankly, I can't remember a young Dominus with this combination of fruit density, freshness and polished tannins. A huge center of fruit emerge with time in the glass in a big, large-scaled Dominus that should provide readers with a long drinking window of pure pleasure once some of the baby fat wears off.","This marries a range of old-school savory, tobacco, chestnut and bay leaf notes with a dense and muscular core of dark currant and blackberry fruit, all backed by a loam-swaddled finish. Long and dense, but defined, with the fruit steadily emerging to win out in the end. Patience is required.

Deep garnet-purple colored, the nose is a little reticent to begin, needing a fair bit of coaxing to reveal beautifully beguiling notions of wild blueberries, warm blackberries, black currant cordial, cloves and cedar chest with nuances of camphor, yeast extract, charcuterie and candied violets. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has fantastic elegance and depth, revealing loads of subtle floral, black fruit and earthy layers with a firm, very finely grained texture and seamless freshness, finishing with epic length.","COMMENTARY: No matter how many Cabs or clarets I taste in my lifetime, the Joseph Phelps Insignia always stands at the head of the class. It is one of the wines amongst a handful of others that I place in that proverbial \"desert island\" category. The 2016 vintage is magnificent. TASTING NOTES: This wine is complete. Its lovely aromas and flavors are impactful and wonderous on the palate. Enjoy its rush of bold, ripe black fruits, and earth with a grilled, well-marbled ribeye topped with minced shallots. (Tasted: February 20, 2020, St. Helena, CA)","Lovely density and intensity with dark berries, blueberries and inky undertones with hints of spice, chocolate and walnuts. Medium to full body, fine tannins and a flavorful finish. The texture and length are fantastic here. Complex. Hints of smoky wood at the end. This needs three to five years more in bottle age. Exciting wine. Try after 2022.","This is a lengthy, powerful blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot and 3% each of Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Together they coalesce as one seamless,\ncomplex experience of black currant, brambly berry and black pepper, with accents of graphite, pencil and cedar. Robust in tannin and youthful energy, it will benefit from aging. Enjoy 2026–2031.\nCellar Selection","Is the 2016 Insignia the next 1997? Coming mostly from the Stags Leap region, with the rest from the Home Ranch, this deep purple-colored beauty offers a magical bouquet of crème de cassis, fruitcake, forest floor, tobacco leaf, and toasted spices. It shows even more complexity with time in the glass and is a full-bodied, powerful, ageworthy example of this cuvée that’s going to benefit from 4-5 years of bottle age and keep for 25+ years or more.","84% Cabernet Sauvignon; 10% Petit Verdot; 3% Malbec; 3% Cabernet Franc. We may well be accused of being monotonous and even a bit biased in the perennial praise that Insignia earns in these pages, but we would remind that we evaluate every wine blind, and, when all is said, tasted and done, Phelps’s flagship bottling is special, very sophisticated stuff and once again claims a place at the very head of the class. It is complex, it is polished and it is extraordinarly deep with an unsurpassed fusion of fruity richness and grace, and if, as usual, it shows the integral tannins of a wine destined to be very long lived, those short on patience and used to savoring young Cabernets cannot fail to find it other than irresistible even now","This is laden with dark currant, blackberry and black cherry preserve flavors, infused gently with alder, incense and black tea notes, all carried by a long swath of fine-grained tannins.

Beautiful notes of creme de cassis, lead pencil shavings, graphite, dried herbs, and loamy earth all flow to a full-bodied, incredibly pure and perfectly balanced Cabernet Sauvignon that has no hard edges, a deep, concentrated mid-palate, good acidity, and a great, great finish. It reminds me of the 2002 with its uber classic, balanced yet broad and powerful style.Rating 98+\n\nRating: 98+","The 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon has a ripe nose with a precise core of generous, healthy and robust red and black fruits. Bursting from the glass, chocolate-covered black cherries with elegant blackberry tones effortlessly strut their stuff next to seductive tones of French oak spices and subtle savory and floral tones. Full-bodied, the wine turns a touch tart in the mouth, with a focused acid structure balanced by lush tannins. The mid-palate is perfectly balanced, with rich dark cherry notes framing the oak expressions. The ripe core of fruit and oak dance vibrantly on the long, elaborate and generous finish, and the aftertaste lingers on for more than a minute after the wine has left the palate. This is a stunning and impressive wine in this vintage, one for collectors to take note of and seek out. 4,975 cases were produced.","The composure here is impressive. Aromas of cedar and dark berries abound, with a strong emphasis on fresh fruit, ahead of oak-derived spices. The palate has superb tannins, super fine but dense and ripe as well, carrying long on the finish. Drink or hold.","Quilceda Creek has been a benchmark in Washington since its first vintage in 1979. Aromas of pitch-black cherry, graphite and spice lead to ripe, intense, layered dark-fruit flavors supported by velvety but firm tannins that lead to a\nwarm finish. As always, time in the cellar will serve\nthis wine well. Best after 2026, with a long life beyond that.\nCellar Selection","Combines polish with a firm, complex structure, offering blackberry, black olive and smoky accents that build richness toward fine-grained tannins.

Beautiful notes of creme de cassis, lead pencil shavings, graphite, dried herbs, and loamy earth all flow to a full-bodied, incredibly pure and perfectly balanced Cabernet Sauvignon that has no hard edges, a deep, concentrated mid-palate, good acidity, and a great, great finish. It reminds me of the 2002 with its uber classic, balanced yet broad and powerful style.Rating 98+\n\nRating: 98+","The 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon has a ripe nose with a precise core of generous, healthy and robust red and black fruits. Bursting from the glass, chocolate-covered black cherries with elegant blackberry tones effortlessly strut their stuff next to seductive tones of French oak spices and subtle savory and floral tones. Full-bodied, the wine turns a touch tart in the mouth, with a focused acid structure balanced by lush tannins. The mid-palate is perfectly balanced, with rich dark cherry notes framing the oak expressions. The ripe core of fruit and oak dance vibrantly on the long, elaborate and generous finish, and the aftertaste lingers on for more than a minute after the wine has left the palate. This is a stunning and impressive wine in this vintage, one for collectors to take note of and seek out. 4,975 cases were produced.","The composure here is impressive. Aromas of cedar and dark berries abound, with a strong emphasis on fresh fruit, ahead of oak-derived spices. The palate has superb tannins, super fine but dense and ripe as well, carrying long on the finish. Drink or hold.","Quilceda Creek has been a benchmark in Washington since its first vintage in 1979. Aromas of pitch-black cherry, graphite and spice lead to ripe, intense, layered dark-fruit flavors supported by velvety but firm tannins that lead to a\nwarm finish. As always, time in the cellar will serve\nthis wine well. Best after 2026, with a long life beyond that.\nCellar Selection","Combines polish with a firm, complex structure, offering blackberry, black olive and smoky accents that build richness toward fine-grained tannins.

This wine seems slightly more expansive, shares the black ruby/purple color with all of it siblings, and has a boatload of crème de cassis, incense, licorice, graphite and vanilla along with plenty of spice box and forest floor. This is a killer, full-bodied, super-duper, opulent Cabernet Sauvignon to drink over the next 20 years.","The 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon RBS Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard is another wine endowed with fabulous overall balance. Hints of blueberry pie, jam, mocha, sweet spices, violets and lavender open up in the glass. Even with all of its obvious intensity, there is a translucence and weightlessness to the 2012 that is utterly mesmerizing. The RBS is rich and powerful, but never heavy. Schrader's RBS is Clone 337 Cabernet, which often yields perfumed, supple Cabernets.","A big and rich wine with blueberry, spice and green coffee bean. Full body, chewy tannins and a fresh finish.

This full-bodied, powerful yet elegant Cabernet Sauvignon couldn’t be better and has incredible purity, layers of crème de cassis, white flowers, tobacco leaf, and flowers, a deep, multi-dimensional texture, and loads of ultra-fine tannins. I’d confidently put this up against any Cabernet Sauvignon in the world. As with the La Muse, it has the balance, purity, and class to drink spectacularly well even today, but it’s another wine that will benefit from a decade of cellaring and keep for 40-50 years.","The 2016 La Joie is a blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. Very deep purple-black in color, it gives up the most gorgeous scents of lilacs, baking spices, incense and star anise with a core of warm cassis, Black Forest cake, redcurrant jelly and unsmoked cigars. Full-bodied and built like a brick house, it has a firm frame of very ripe, grainy tannins and bold, multilayered black fruit, finishing very long and very spicy.","Wonderful purity of cabernet on the nose with blackcurrants and fresh lavender. Full body, with ultra-fine tannins and great beauty in the texture and flavors. It changes all the time. Extremely complex. 84 per cent cabernet sauvignon, 11 per cent merlot and five per cent petit verdot. So approachable, but needs at least three to four years to come together completely.","The 2016 La Joie soars out of the glass with stunning Cabernet Sauvignon red berry fruit, wild flowers, mocha, spice and mint.

I’d confidently put this up against any Cabernet Sauvignon in the world.

Full-bodied and built like a brick house, it has a firm frame of very ripe, grainy tannins and bold, multilayered black fruit, finishing very long and very spicy.","Wonderful purity of cabernet on the nose with blackcurrants and fresh lavender. Full body, with ultra-fine tannins and great beauty in the texture and flavors. It changes all the time.

The rows of sharp tannins are very defined and agile, and the acidity is tensely strung up in overtures of vivacious red fruit. A beautiful, nimble Brunello 2015. Drink from 2024.","Altesino's 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Montosoli shows those celebrated characteristics of this special vineyard cru that are always portrayed with pronounced mineral intensity, with highlights of crushed granite and pencil shaving. Indeed, Altesino's five-hectare Montosoli vineyard sees a greater concentration of clay schist Galestro rock, and the vineyard altitude (at 350 meters above sea level) adds to the wine's perceived freshness. In this case, those mineral notes are applied with small brush strokes, as the core of the wine is occupied by wild fruit and forest berry. Medicinal herb and rosemary essence appear quietly at the back. This is a very compact and bright wine with young tannins and solid structure. It has all the attributes you look for in a candidate that can withstand long cellar aging. I'd suggest waiting five years or more before popping this cork. Some 19,000 bottles were filled in July 2019, and the wine was released in January 2020. Rating:96+","The 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Montosoli has a dark, hauntingly beautiful bouquet, displaying ripe blackberry and cherry with spicy, dark florals, as well as a hint of animal musk, which manages to ground the experience in the earth. On the palate, velvety textures, offset by tart red and black fruits, with juicy acidity maintain balance, as sweet cherries and rosemary give way to a core of minerality and hints of fine tannin. It finishes long and elegant, showing dark inner florals, ripe blackberry and lingering sweet spices. It’s interesting to taste this next to the classic Brunello from 2015, as I find them to be equally enjoyable, but for completely different reasons. Drinking window: 2024 - 2044.","Rich and round, featuring cherry, raspberry, floral and mineral aromas and flavors. Graceful and intense, showing terrific balance, with a long, fruit-, tobacco- and mineral-tinged aftertaste. Exhibits fine purity and freshness. Best from 2023 through 2040.","Altesino owns five precious hectares on the hill of Montosoli, Brunello's most renowned unofficial cru which is located on the sun-kissed hill north of the town of Montalcino. The 2015 is already showing some evolution on the nose, with aromas tending toward smoky tea and dried tobacco. More youthful on the palate, it is replete with ripe cherries and raspberries laced with thyme, flinty stone and mint. It is velvety in texture, though the tannins cling tightly to the finish.

Extremely aromatic. Full-bodied, yet so tight and polished with incredible tannin structure that gives the wine an endless mouth feel of caressing tannins, acidity and fruit. There’s a fabulous saltiness and oyster-shell undertone to the fruit. Unique. Drinkable already, but this year there’s the structure to last decades.","Giacomo Neri and his family have crafted a wine that impresses from the first sip forward (especially when the wine is given ample time to open). The Casanova di Neri 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova must be treated with patience, and that patience is returned with many great rewards. Blackberry, plum and summer cherry are slowly folded into lasting flavors of spice, leather and beautiful balsam or medical herb. These are always a distinctive signature of this estate. The aromas flow with seamless transitions, and that fluid and ever-changing nature of the bouquet is what helps to build intensity and staying power. Fruit is harvested from a south- and southeast-facing slope at 250 to 300 meters above sea level. The soils are mixed loosely with crushed rock, allowing access to air and moisture. Indeed, pretty mineral accents appear as the wine takes on more air in the glass. What stands out most in this Brunello is the quality of the bouquet that is rigid and firm, yet not excessively so. You feel the structural texture of the wine as it sits firmly over the palate, yet there is mobility and softness to its many moving parts. I tasted this wine at various intervals over a 24-hour period.Rating: 98+","Tenuta Nuova has been produced since 1993. It represents Casanova di Neri's 'newer' vineyard of Le Cetine in the southern reaches of Montalcino which boasts stony galestro soils. This manages the warmth and ripeness of the vintage with tremendous sophistication. Balsamic herbs, Mediterranean shrub, juniper and crushed stone overlay layers of focused, luscious currants and black cherries. A bit of an iron fist in a velvet glove - but much more velvet glove than iron fist. Finishes long and invigoratingly salty.","The 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova was quite restrained at first, requiring time in the glass to fully blossom, as subtle red berry fruits slowly gain volume and are then complemented by sweet red florals with hints of exotic spice, peppery herbs, and dusty minerals. On the palate, silky textures flood the senses with rich red berry fruits and sweet herbal tones, leaving hints of savory spice and minerals in their wake. The finish is long and unexpectedly fresh, showing the first hints of round tannins under a top note of sweet cherry, plum and a hint of black tea. There is so much going on here, yet it is all densely wrapped up in its youthful state.

Extremely aromatic. Full-bodied, yet so tight and polished with incredible tannin structure that gives the wine an endless mouth feel of caressing tannins, acidity and fruit. There’s a fabulous saltiness and oyster-shell undertone to the fruit. Unique. Drinkable already, but this year there’s the structure to last decades.","Giacomo Neri and his family have crafted a wine that impresses from the first sip forward (especially when the wine is given ample time to open). The Casanova di Neri 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova must be treated with patience, and that patience is returned with many great rewards. Blackberry, plum and summer cherry are slowly folded into lasting flavors of spice, leather and beautiful balsam or medical herb. These are always a distinctive signature of this estate. The aromas flow with seamless transitions, and that fluid and ever-changing nature of the bouquet is what helps to build intensity and staying power. Fruit is harvested from a south- and southeast-facing slope at 250 to 300 meters above sea level. The soils are mixed loosely with crushed rock, allowing access to air and moisture. Indeed, pretty mineral accents appear as the wine takes on more air in the glass. What stands out most in this Brunello is the quality of the bouquet that is rigid and firm, yet not excessively so. You feel the structural texture of the wine as it sits firmly over the palate, yet there is mobility and softness to its many moving parts. I tasted this wine at various intervals over a 24-hour period.Rating: 98+","Tenuta Nuova has been produced since 1993. It represents Casanova di Neri's 'newer' vineyard of Le Cetine in the southern reaches of Montalcino which boasts stony galestro soils. This manages the warmth and ripeness of the vintage with tremendous sophistication. Balsamic herbs, Mediterranean shrub, juniper and crushed stone overlay layers of focused, luscious currants and black cherries. A bit of an iron fist in a velvet glove - but much more velvet glove than iron fist. Finishes long and invigoratingly salty.","The 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova was quite restrained at first, requiring time in the glass to fully blossom, as subtle red berry fruits slowly gain volume and are then complemented by sweet red florals with hints of exotic spice, peppery herbs, and dusty minerals. On the palate, silky textures flood the senses with rich red berry fruits and sweet herbal tones, leaving hints of savory spice and minerals in their wake. The finish is long and unexpectedly fresh, showing the first hints of round tannins under a top note of sweet cherry, plum and a hint of black tea. There is so much going on here, yet it is all densely wrapped up in its youthful state.

The fruit is carried through to the long, chewy finish by the highly refreshing acidity. Drink in 2020.","San Lorenzo is the most representative wine of Castello di Ama. Rather than a single vineyard, it's a selection across all four of the estate's sites from more mature vines with an average age of 20-25 years old. Winter mint, anise and tobacco are laced through the wine, mingling with vanilla nuances. The fruit is dense, dark and powerful in the mouth but there's a plushness on the mid-palate that lends a seductive edge. Magnificent velvety tannins keep it all in check while the finishes lingers graciously.","An elegant version, saturated with black cherry, blackberry, graphite and tar flavors, this red delivers a solid backbone of tannins and bright acidity.

This has a meaty nose with savoury hedgerow fruit , surprisingly open already. I had to put an exclamation mark after writing 'elegant' in my notes, as it seems incomprehensible that a wine of this magnitude could still have such balletic balance. It is broad and juicy, with chalky grip and clean, fresh acids followed by a hint of warmth on the long finish.","This was an excellent vintage in much of Italy, but unfortunately the weather was not as pleasant in this specific area of the Valpolicella. The season saw a lot of rain, and a good amount of fruit was cut and left on the ground because it could not be used. Considering these difficulties, Michele Dal Forno tells me he is \"more than happy with the results.\" I tasted the 2010 Amarone della Valpolicella Monte Lodoletta next to the 2009 vintage, and having these two wines side by side reinforces just how different they are. The 2010 vintages is sharper, more pointed and direct in comparison, and there is a tiny point of sourness on the close. This wine does not reach the same threshold for fullness, density or richness. It does come close. The wine's residual sugar measures between 5 and 6 grams per liter, which is normal for this wine, and the bouquet is redolent of familiar black fruit, raisin and spice. However, the wine feels a bit stuck in its tracks at the moment and is evidently experiencing a shy phase in its evolution. It has retreated.","Like a gymnast, this focused red shows both power and grace. Finely meshed flavors of blackberry puree, fig cake and Earl Grey tea leaf are framed by refined, dusty tannins, with a lasting finish expands on the palate with spice and smoky mineral details. Drink now through 2030.","Amazing aromas of dried fruits, burnt orange and walnut skin. Full-bodied, chewy and very rich and dry, with wonderful tannin-fruit tension.

Although I can't claim any extraordinary differences between the two sessions, I noticed a few minimal shifts that are essential to understanding the wine's future aging ability. The 2016 Barbaresco starts off slow at first, showing a small margin of aromatic evolution in the glass. But come back two hours later, and you can almost hear the soft sounds of the symphony playing just below the surface. The 2016 vintage is characterized by the solid intensity and firmness of its aromas, which transcend fruit and veer toward balsamic herb, licorice, tar and smoke instead. The tannins offer a moment of sweetness and softness, before you are aware of their undeniable firmness. In all, there is a certain glossiness or satiny quality to the mouthfeel that underlines the wine's carefully crafted integration. I would describe this as a classic and also a somewhat austere Barbaresco that fully deserves extra cellar time to stretch those tight muscles and grow in volume. This wine will award those who wait.","This is all about finesse with power. Such great length here with ever so refined tannins and precise strawberry, cedar, dried-rose and mineral character. Medium body. Fresh and vivid finish. Hard not to drink now, but wait until at least 2021.","The Gaja family calls 2016 one of the best vintages they have ever experienced, with a long, slow ripening period without heat stress or disease pressure. That balance comes through in this suave, elegant Barbaresco. It smells of soft rose petals and tastes of juicy cherries and spiced raspberries, the flavors gliding along smooth, ripe tannins. With air, the wine picks up energy and depth, moving into a long, vibrant finish.","The 2016 Barbaresco showed beautifully, with a classical yet seductive and sweetly fruited style that's going to evolve gracefully. Medium ruby-hued, with a core of sweet red fruits balanced by classic dried flowers, licorice, asphalt, and medicinal herbs, it hits the palate with medium-bodied richness that carries impress sweet fruit as well as building tannins. Barbaresco doesn't get more classic, and while it has a sunny, sweetly fruited style, it also has ample underlying tannins and structure, so give bottles 4-5 years. It should deliver the goods for two decades or more.","The nose is poised, displaying very ripe raspberry and black berry aromas. The attack has intensity, partly thanks to its pungent acidity, but there's no rawness and the tannins are ripe. This is taut and structured and needs time. While concentrated, it's not excessively so, and the wine retains its delicacy through the very long finish.

The vibrant, full-bodied palate is all about flair and finesse, delivering crushed raspberry, Marasca cherry, licorice and a hint of tobacco, all framed by taut, fine-grained tannins. Young and intense, it will be ideal after a few more years of aging, but will continue to develop for decades. Drink 2023–2040.","Wow. Such depth in the nose of strawberries, flowers and hints of raw meat. Crushed stones, too. Full body, fine and dusty tannins and a long and flavorful finish. Shows structure and finesse. Drink in 2020.","From a cooler, hillside site to the southeast of the appellation with heavier clay and limestone soils. This expresses a cooler style of Nebbiolo, leaning towards a Pinot Noir flavour profile. It has a floral character with a gorgeous perfume of citrus notes and raspberries. Pure red berry sweetness with succulent, juicy acidity and racy tannins. Stunningly elegant, this is delicious and desirable now. Wonderful to drink or keep. Aged in 30% new oak.Drinking Window 2018 - 2035","Earthy base notes are the hallmarks of this rich, muscular red. Plum, cherry,\nspice, tobacco and mineral flavors mingle, and the refined tannins provide lift\non the long aftertaste. Best from 2023 through 2042.","The 2015 Barbaresco Costa Russi was about to be bottled before I tasted it. Like the other wines from this warm vintage, you are treated to extra plushness and roundness with dark berry fruit intensity. This wine also offers unexpected mineral tones that come off as crushed oyster shell and talc powder. These add to the drying, almost nervous, tension you feel in the mouth."],"price":"$500","color":"no data, see reviews","colorIntensity":"no data, see reviews","noseIntensity":"no

Its sandy limestone soil provides perfect drainage and produces good tannin structure. This wine has depth, concentration and sweet primary fruit, with a touch of violet, meat, sweet cherry and wild raspberry. Lovely, polished tannins with some grip. It has benefitted from a slightly longer maceration, as well as eight months in barriques – seamlessly suffused into the wine – before spending the rest of the ageing period in large oak barrels.\nDrinking Window 2018 - 2037","A bright, fruity version, boasting strawberry, cherry, floral, mineral and\ntobacco flavors, this is dense, solidly structured and vibrant, with a lingering,\nracy aftertaste.

The 2015 Barbaresco Sorì San Lorenzo offers a complex bouquet with dark fruit, crushed mineral and grilled herb.

It reminds me of the incredible 1997, and Barolo doesn't get any more sexy or opulent. This brilliant, full-bodied wine has ripe, velvety tannins, beautiful depth of fruit, and a great finish. It needs a solid hour in a decanter if drinking any time soon and will benefit from 5-7 years of bottle age. It should drink brilliantly over the following 25-30 years.","In the 2015 vintage, Sperss is like a strong and supple thoroughbred, balancing Serralunga’s muscular tannins with taut, fluid red-fruit tones. Notes of thyme, fennel frond and orange peel bring it freshness, while the girding of cool iron and graphite tones promise that this will reward a decade or more of cellaring.","In the 2015 Barolo Sperss, you can taste the iron rust and minerality that is so specific to the soils of Serralunga d'Alba where this wine is born. It is very bold and represents the more powerful of these two wines from Barolo. Cerequio is always the more floral, while the Sperss has an immediate cherry and some lingering, bold, blackberry aromas that make a strong impact. However, this wine does not have the austerity of a classic Barolo. Instead it shows a richer texture and it casts a wider net of flavors. Serralunga d'Alba fruit is marked by stronger concentration and ripeness, with a very firm and unyielding quality of tannin that should hold the wine steady as it moves through its aging evolution. This is a truly beautiful albeit brawny Nebbiolo.Rating: 97(+)","Very ripe strawberry and cherry aromas with undertones of flowers and cedar. Hints of fresh leather, too.

It is most often intensely aromatic, mid-weight and frequently out of balance, especially right after bottling. The 2007 is none of those things. It is a rich, dramatic wine endowed with tons of fruit and a sweeping, enveloping personality. It is also primary and at the beginning of what is likely to be a long, long life. Despite its seeming fragility, Monprivato is one of the most long-lived of all Baroli, even in its weakest vintages. The 2007 is spectacular, but it is very, very young and in need of significant cellaring to shed some its baby fat. Purists may prefer the 2006. I have not tasted both wines side by side from bottle, but 10 years from now it won’t matter. Readers will be thrilled to own either. In 2007 Mascarello opted not to bottle his Riserva Ca’ d’Morissio as he didn’t think there was a huge difference between the Riserva and the straight Monprivato. I guess we will never know for sure, although my barrel tastings have always suggested otherwise. In any event, savvy readers know what happens when there is no Ca' d'Morissio in a good to great vintage. Recent examples include the 1999 and 2005. By now, its pretty clear the direction those wines have taken. Barolo lovers will not want to be without the 2007 Monprivato. It is a stratospheric Barolo in the making. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2037.","A pure, ethereal Barolo, boasting rose, cherry and strawberry aromas and flavors, with a touch of tar.

It is most often intensely aromatic, mid-weight and frequently out of balance, especially right after bottling. The 2007 is none of those things. It is a rich, dramatic wine endowed with tons of fruit and a sweeping, enveloping personality. It is also primary and at the beginning of what is likely to be a long, long life. Despite its seeming fragility, Monprivato is one of the most long-lived of all Baroli, even in its weakest vintages. The 2007 is spectacular, but it is very, very young and in need of significant cellaring to shed some its baby fat. Purists may prefer the 2006. I have not tasted both wines side by side from bottle, but 10 years from now it won’t matter. Readers will be thrilled to own either. In 2007 Mascarello opted not to bottle his Riserva Ca’ d’Morissio as he didn’t think there was a huge difference between the Riserva and the straight Monprivato. I guess we will never know for sure, although my barrel tastings have always suggested otherwise. In any event, savvy readers know what happens when there is no Ca' d'Morissio in a good to great vintage. Recent examples include the 1999 and 2005. By now, its pretty clear the direction those wines have taken. Barolo lovers will not want to be without the 2007 Monprivato. It is a stratospheric Barolo in the making. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2037.","A pure, ethereal Barolo, boasting rose, cherry and strawberry aromas and flavors, with a touch of tar. Very harmonious and elegant, with firm yet well-delineated tannins supporting the whole. Old-school and refined.

Full body with generous fruit, but the firm and beautifully woven tannin backbone keeps the palate fine and elegant. Very long on the finish. Drink in 2024.","There is a gorgeous nuttiness to the 2015 Paleo. It is a highly aromatic expression of Cabernet Franc, with a bouquet of roses and some notes of red cherry. The vineyard team was careful in timing the harvest and fermentations to make sure the fruit did not come in too ripe and so they could maintain the natural freshness of the grapes. The oak used is moderately to highly toasted so they could get more of those nutty notes instead of the more common coffee or chocolate aromas we associate with barrique. It is aged for 22 months and the overall result is incredible.","This red is sleek and concentrated, featuring black currant, black cherry, licorice, tobacco and leather flavors. Balanced and juicy, with a long, mineral-tinged aftertaste. The firm structure will allow this to age.","Black currant, exotic spice, coconut and espresso mingle with whiffs of violet and cedar. On the smooth, delicious palate, fine-grained tannins give elegant support to cassis, pipe tobacco, chocolate, licorice and coffee. It's surprisingly fresh for the vintage.

","flavors":[]}],"professionalReviews":["There’s a very fresh array here of thyme, newly picked blackcurrants, iodine, crushed stones and sea salt. The exuberant fruit is matched nicely to fine and elegant tannins, which paint a compact and neat picture on the medium-to full-bodied palate. Drink in 2021.","This is another extremely popular wine that is easily found up and down the Tuscan Coast. This red blend (with the largest part of the blend going to Cabernet Sauvignon) opens to a soft and velvety texture. The 2017 Bolgheri Rosso Il Bruciato offers some noticeable ripeness with black cherry, prune and raisin. But ultimately, the wine shows a good level of freshness because the acidity in the grapes was concentrated (like everything else in this hot vintage) in the year’s smaller berries. Tenuta Guado al Tasso extends over 340 hectares. Because of the hot vintage, only 65,000 cases were made of this wine instead of the 100,000 cases produced in a normal vintage.","The 2017 Bolgheri Il Bruciato is pliant, supple and luscious, but what stands out most is how much freshness Antinori was able to keep in this wine. Dark red cherry, plum, spice, new leather and floral notes all meld together in this sumptuous, racy red. This is such a pretty and expressive wine."],"price":"$119.99","color":"no data, see reviews","colorIntensity":"no data, see reviews","noseIntensity":"no data","noseDevelopment":"no data","body":"no data, see structure","quality":"no data, see scores","tertiaryFlavors":"combined with secondary","aromaIntensity":"no data, see reviews","primaryAromas":"no data, see flavor","secondaryAromas":"no data, see flavor","tertiaryAromas":"no data, see flavor","ageing":"no data, cellar-tracker?","balance":"no data, see reviews","length":"no data, see reviews","finish":"no data, see reviews","intensity":"pronounced","complexity":"no data, see reviews","conclusion":"no data, see professional reviews"},{"_id":2446729,"_vintageId":17261062,"name":"Toscana","vintage":"2015","description":"Intense ruby in colour.

It shows loads of blackberry, blackcurrant and walnut flavors. Ripe yet polished tannins. Give this three or four years to come together.","A stunning wine, the 2017 Ornellaia offers a captivating interplay of richness and energy. Picking early was the key. Young vine Cabernet Sauvignon and Franc were harvested in August for the first time ever. In the glass, the 2017 offers up an enticing mélange of mocha, cedar, tobacco and licorice, with soft curves that add to its sensuality and allure. The 2017 is sumptuous and racy, as Ornellaias from warmer years tend to be, but it is not at all heavy or overdone. In a word: superb!","This vintage of Ornellaia is called Solare and represents the 12th edition in the estate's Vendemmia d'Artista series featuring artwork by Tomás Saraceno. His beautiful art depicts a radiant sun halo and is intended as a symbol of sustainability. That theme of sunshine and warmth is particularly well suited to a vintage such as this. The Ornellaia 2017 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia is generous and fruit-forward with dense richness and concentration all driven by the smaller and more compact berry size that characterizes this dry, hot growing season. Black and purple fruits segue to spice, tobacco, leather and some of those beautiful Mediterranean notes of black olive and wild sage. These various moving pieces work together in perfect harmony. The tannins are beautifully managed here. If you consider the more astringent and rougher approach of the mid-tier Le Serre Nuove dell'Ornellaia, this wine shows a whole other level of magnificent tannic management that could not have been easy given the diminutive berry size. This vintage sees a blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 9% Cabernet Franc. The vineyard soils are characterized by reddish sand with calcareous rock. The wine is fermented in both stainless steel and cement and is transferred over to barrique to finish malolactic fermentation. It ages in barrique for 18 months followed by another 12 months in bottle."],"price":"$240","color":"no data, see reviews","colorIntensity":"no data, see reviews","noseIntensity":"no data","noseDevelopment":"no data","body":"no data, see structure","quality":"no data, see scores","tertiaryFlavors":"combined with secondary","aromaIntensity":"no data, see reviews","primaryAromas":"no data, see flavor","secondaryAromas":"no data, see flavor","tertiaryAromas":"no data, see flavor","ageing":"no data, cellar-tracker?","balance":"no data, see reviews","length":"no data, see reviews","finish":"no data, see reviews","intensity":"pronounced","complexity":"no data, see reviews","conclusion":"no data, see professional reviews"},{"_id":22447,"_vintageId":14146987,"name":"Bolgheri Superiore","vintage":"2015","description":"With its dense, vibrant colour, it has a nose of splendid aromatic complexity built around a limpid and brilliant fruitiness, underscored by refined spicy and balsamic notes.

The smooth, tightly knit palate offers succulent black cherry, cranberry compote, coconut and espresso alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. A licorice note graces the finish. Drink 2022–2030.","Luciano Sandrone expected this would be a beautiful year for Nebbiolo, with fruit showing the qualities of an important wine all throughout the growing season and right up to harvest. And yes, the 2015 Barolo le Vigne did turn out to be a great vintage, with a full aromatic array of perfumed rose, lavender and violet. For all of its generosity and expressiveness, with just a beautiful bouquet that sings out a seductive mezzo-soprano aria, be forewarned that in the mouth this is followed by rigidity and nervousness. That explosive bouquet might mislead you into thinking this is a rather evolved wine, but you certainly feel its youth on the palate. To be frank, this was an easy year to make wine, and it's not a big surprise that this edition of le Vigne turned out to be as classic and as good as it is. It should get even better with time. Rating: 95+","Distinctive aromas of freshly mowed hay, blood orange and cherry mark this supple, elegant and vibrant Barolo. Tightens up on the finish, but chalk that up to youthful exuberance.

Drink 2022–2032.","The 2017 Sassicaia is dark, sensual and rich, which is a good thing, as the tannins - the result of a warm, dry year in which phenolic ripening was difficult to fully reach - are also quite powerful. I tasted the 2017 from an approximate blend from barrel, where the wines are still aging in separate lots. It will be interesting to see where things end up once the wine is in bottle.Rating: 93-96","The balance and beauty to this is impressive, offering sweet, ripe currants and flowers with some crushed-stone and dry-earth undertones. Full-bodied with soft, polished tannins and a long, creamy-textured finish. It’s polished, yet concentrated. Better after 2022, but already very seductive.","To recap my assessment, and with the memory of the 100-point 2016 vintage so fresh in my mind, I would give this wine a seven out of 10 in terms of aromas, a five out of 10 in terms of mid-palate, and an eight out of 10 in terms of structure. Another way to read those conclusions is as follows: The 2017 Sassicaia was expertly built to withstand a long aging future, yet only time will tell if the beauty of the bouquet will evolve at the same pace. This fascinating wine magically captures the hallmarks of cool-temperature winemaking in one of the hottest vintages in recent years.

Notes of bright red fruit. Raspberry, cherries, vanilla, tar and licorice flavors are bright and long. ","flavors":["licorice","raspberry","tar","red fruit","vanilla"]},{"notes":"Intense, bold, yet very enjoyable. Taste grows on you after every sip. No wonder was rated top wine in the world. Had at a tasting 10/22/18 at the castle in Montalcino. ","flavors":[]}],"professionalReviews":["Aromas of exotic spice, baked plum and French oak mingle with camphor and blue flower on the nose. This boasts extraordinary elegance and freshness despite the hot vintage, delivering flavors of juicy Marasca cherry, spiced blueberry, tobacco and licorice. Velvety, fine-grained tannins provide support while coffee and crushed mint linger on the finish. Drink 2022–2032.","The 2017 Sassicaia is dark, sensual and rich, which is a good thing, as the tannins - the result of a warm, dry year in which phenolic ripening was difficult to fully reach - are also quite powerful. I tasted the 2017 from an approximate blend from barrel, where the wines are still aging in separate lots. It will be interesting to see where things end up once the wine is in bottle.Rating: 93-96","The balance and beauty to this is impressive, offering sweet, ripe currants and flowers with some crushed-stone and dry-earth undertones. Full-bodied with soft, polished tannins and a long, creamy-textured finish. It’s polished, yet concentrated. Better after 2022, but already very seductive.","To recap my assessment, and with the memory of the 100-point 2016 vintage so fresh in my mind, I would give this wine a seven out of 10 in terms of aromas, a five out of 10 in terms of mid-palate, and an eight out of 10 in terms of structure. Another way to read those conclusions is as follows: The 2017 Sassicaia was expertly built to withstand a long aging future, yet only time will tell if the beauty of the bouquet will evolve at the same pace. This fascinating wine magically captures the hallmarks of cool-temperature winemaking in one of the hottest vintages in recent years.

Great potential.","flavors":["nutty","balsamic","black cherry","red plum","strawberry","minerals"]}],"professionalReviews":["Starting off a bit shy and closed at first, the 2015 Barolo Ravera showed noticeably better in the sample that had been opened a few hours prior to my arrival at the winery for my annual visit. This makes perfect sense as Vietti’s wines are intentionally slow at first but are built to endure the long haul. From the Novello township, this vineyard site is recognized for it power, structure and the uniquely broad approach it shows to the palate. There is a larger span of black fruit at its core. The positioning of the Ravera cru means it is open to the elements and the cold air from the Alps, and the wines result in freshness and mineral character as well. Luca Currado describes a salty, anchovy-like aroma that does indeed appear. Otherwise, this wine shows tightly polished and glossy tannins.","This Barolo, from Novello’s Ravera cru, leads off an impressive set of 2015 releases from Luca Currado. It’s rich and lively, with flavors of black cherry and seeded raspberry laced with notes of menthol, licorice and tobacco. Highly appealing for its energy and layered complexity, the wine has formidable tannins that call for patience. §","The beautifully fragrant roses are impossible to resist. This oozes charm. Also, there are red cherries, cocoa powder and an array of wild herbs in the mix. The palate has toned yet muscular tannins that build nicely to deliver a concentrated core of ripe red-cherry flavor that holds long, fresh and youthful. Great Barolo. Try from 2022.","The 2015 Barolo Ravera is once again the head of the class at Vietti. Bright, sculpted and wonderfully nuanced, the Ravera is very pretty. Floral aromatics and the pointed, brilliant fruit that is such a Ravera signature are very much in evidence. Hints of blood orange, mint, crushed rocks and flowers add shades of complexity as the 2015 gradually opens up in the glass. This is one of the finer wines of the year. Don't miss it!","This red is full of sweet ripe plum, cherry and tar flavors, accented by\ntobacco and underbrush notes. Thick, dusty tannins coat the gums and put a\nclamp on the finish for now, but this shows potential. Best from 2023\nthrough 2045.","The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals balsamic aromas of camphor that mingle with blue flowers and pipe tobacco. It’s full bodied and austere, delivering dried cherry, pomegranate and licorice framed in tightly woven, grainy tannins that leave a firm, drying finish. Drink 2023–2030.","Luca Currado at Vietti offers a very different expression of Ravera that's more extracted and structured than Abrigo's. It shows abundant aromatic force on the nose, with its lush cherry and tobacco aromas. There's fine weight of fruit and considerable density here, and it's robust without being too rugged.

They have preserved an 'inferno' tunnel used historically for ageing, and at times hiding, their wine. Ravera is one of the 5 crus, single vineyard wines. Novello commune. It's an impressive wine, good intensity, big structure, lovely balance. Spiciness and minerals, slightly herby. Some rose and balsamic in the aromatics, a little nutty from barrique ageing. Black cherry, red plum, a bit of strawberry. Great potential.","flavors":["nutty","balsamic","black cherry","red plum","strawberry","minerals"]}],"professionalReviews":["Starting off a bit shy and closed at first, the 2015 Barolo Ravera showed noticeably better in the sample that had been opened a few hours prior to my arrival at the winery for my annual visit. This makes perfect sense as Vietti’s wines are intentionally slow at first but are built to endure the long haul. From the Novello township, this vineyard site is recognized for it power, structure and the uniquely broad approach it shows to the palate. There is a larger span of black fruit at its core. The positioning of the Ravera cru means it is open to the elements and the cold air from the Alps, and the wines result in freshness and mineral character as well. Luca Currado describes a salty, anchovy-like aroma that does indeed appear. Otherwise, this wine shows tightly polished and glossy tannins.","This Barolo, from Novello’s Ravera cru, leads off an impressive set of 2015 releases from Luca Currado. It’s rich and lively, with flavors of black cherry and seeded raspberry laced with notes of menthol, licorice and tobacco. Highly appealing for its energy and layered complexity, the wine has formidable tannins that call for patience. §","The beautifully fragrant roses are impossible to resist. This oozes charm. Also, there are red cherries, cocoa powder and an array of wild herbs in the mix. The palate has toned yet muscular tannins that build nicely to deliver a concentrated core of ripe red-cherry flavor that holds long, fresh and youthful. Great Barolo. Try from 2022.","The 2015 Barolo Ravera is once again the head of the class at Vietti. Bright, sculpted and wonderfully nuanced, the Ravera is very pretty. Floral aromatics and the pointed, brilliant fruit that is such a Ravera signature are very much in evidence. Hints of blood orange, mint, crushed rocks and flowers add shades of complexity as the 2015 gradually opens up in the glass. This is one of the finer wines of the year. Don't miss it!","This red is full of sweet ripe plum, cherry and tar flavors, accented by\ntobacco and underbrush notes. Thick, dusty tannins coat the gums and put a\nclamp on the finish for now, but this shows potential. Best from 2023\nthrough 2045.","The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals balsamic aromas of camphor that mingle with blue flowers and pipe tobacco. It’s full bodied and austere, delivering dried cherry, pomegranate and licorice framed in tightly woven, grainy tannins that leave a firm, drying finish. Drink 2023–2030.","Luca Currado at Vietti offers a very different expression of Ravera that's more extracted and structured than Abrigo's. It shows abundant aromatic force on the nose, with its lush cherry and tobacco aromas. There's fine weight of fruit and considerable density here, and it's robust without being too rugged. It's a solid and complex style, but it's also spicy and lively, and in no way heavy-handed.

The recent editions have been nothing short of spectacular, earning 100-point scores in both 2007 and 2009 and 99 points in its latest appearance, 2010. It's a series that has set the bar extraordinarily high, and this 2012 Barolo Riserva Villero is a little less exciting in comparison. However, the wine holds its own as one of the most beautiful in the entire appellation and one of the best in the somewhat lackluster vintage. Balsamic and truffle notes pepper the palate of this handsome Barolo, but it's just really hard to reproduce that magic, release after release, for a wine regularly expected to sell at several hundred dollars apiece.","This delivers a handy play between dried cherries, tar and pomegranate and fresh rose petals and citrus with lilac undertones; it’s a very fresh and expert rendition of the hot 2012 vintage.

Nose: Classic Kalimna, with trademark red fruits and a familial old-worldliness. Via: juniper and blackberry fruits, and raspberry stick and red licorice flavorings. And: a carbon black ‘sumpiness’/quince paste amalgam laced with a ferric/formic piquant lift. Also: possibly oak-induced, barrel-fermented eugenol/pink peppercorn/fresh green-tobacco aromatics.

Full bodied, with big velvety tannins and a long, long finish. Amazing sliced meat and fruit character. Fabulous wine that just blows me away and makes me think of great pre-phyloxera Bordeaux of 1864 and 1865. From vines in the mid-1880s. About 10 acres. 500 cases. Screwcap.","It’s not known exactly when the Kalimna Block 42 was planted but there are suggestions that the vines existed during the latter part of the 19th Century. They could be the oldest Cabernet vines in the world, although the famous Metala Cabernet vineyard in Langhorne Creek was known to have been planted in 1891 so could very well pre-date Kalimna. Regardless, I’ve been there and the vines are truly old. Only very rarely does Penfolds release this as a single vineyard wine, when the Cabernet is so fabulous it can’t possibly be blended. The 2004 Block 42 Kalimna Cabernet Sauvignon was such a vintage. Matured in 100% new American hogsheads for 13 months, it displays a very deep garnet-purple color and profoundly earthy / gamey aromas over black cherry preserves, creme de cassis plus scents of leather, pencil shavings, Mediterranean herbs, black truffles, underbrush and black olives. The elegant, medium-bodied palate is tightly-knit and led by structure with a high level of grainy tannins, very high acid and a long earthy finish. Approachable now, it should continue to evolve and drink to 2025+.","Delicious stuff; not huge, but impeccably balanced, nuanced and tremendously long and pure. It's a cascade of currant, blueberry and plum fruit shaded on one side by subtle, toasty oak, on the other by hints of minerality and exotic spice. But it's the elegance and the length that make this a winner.","This is incredibly dark, concentrated stuff from what may be the oldest (planted in 1886) continuously producing Cabernet vineyard in the world. Minty, herbal notes combine with chocolate and cassis to yield a complex, balanced whole. Despite the density of the fruit, there’s absolutely no sense of heaviness or excessive weight, and while the tannins appear creamy on the midpalate, they fan out into a silky sheen on the lingering finish. About 500 cases produced.

Some very good wines and this gentlemen really knows these wines....

Aromas of orange and lemon peel to start, then graphite, blackberries, plum paste, black cherries, boundless sweet oak spice, fresh cedar, tar, mahogany, roasted coffee and chocolate - the list goes on. Such complexity. Classic Grange, offering such deep, dark intensity. The palate has immense richness and depth with a super succulent and very long, fleshy, deeply weighted array of dense, velvet-wrapped tannins that run so long. The fruit flavors sit in the blackberry, blood-plum and blueberry zone with succulent, long and assertive structure, carrying through in an utterly seamless mode. The finish is tightly wrenched, in spectacularly powerful style, locking this wine in for a very long haul. Best from 2030.","The flagship 2015 Grange is a monster of wine and one of those rare wines that blends power and elegance perfectly. Revealing a saturated purple color, it’s seemingly more forward and seductive than past great vintages, which I suspect is due to the incredible purity of fruit as well as the wine’s flawless balance than any change in winemaking or stylistic shifts. I also think the acidity is healthy, and the 2015 tips the scales at 14.5% alcohol, which is certainly in the sweet spot, if not tame, for beautifully ripe Syrah these days. A blend of 98% Shiraz and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon that spent 20 months in new American oak hogsheads, it offers an extraordinary perfume of sweet crème de cassis, lead pencil shavings, camphor, Asian spices, licorice, and wildflowers. This is followed by a full-bodied, powerful yet incredibly seamless and elegant Shiraz that has no hard edges, a big, dense mid-palate, ripe tannins, and a great finish. Coming close to rivaling the 1986, which has always been a benchmark vintage of Grange for me, the 2015 offers a more polished, elegant, approachable style. Vintage comparisons aside, this is a legendary example of Grange in the making. The savvy wine lovers out there will give this 7-8 years of bottle age (I’ll probably be out of bottles by then) and enjoy over the following 2-3 decades.","The nose of the 2015 Grange features the wine's characteristic lifted aromas, joined by pronounced American oak influence and bold blackberry fruit, plus hints of red meat, raspberries, asphalt and vanilla. It's dense and concentrated on the palate, full-bodied yet balanced and firm, with a rich, velvety texture and long, plush finish. Don't expect great complexity at this stage—it's much too young to show much more than the primary fruit and oak elements—but this is a Grange that should easily go three or four decades.Rating: 98+","This vintage of the famed wine is perhaps its most approachable to date. The nose is open and expressive, with waves of aromas ranging from licorice, currant and plum to baking spice, furniture polish, freshly picked olive, mushroom and vanilla. The mouthfeel is satiny in texture, awash with fruit and spices of all shapes and sizes, all wound by fine tannins. Drink through 2040.","In 2015, the power, complexity and refinement of Grange hides behind its initial volatility. That’s part of the style Max Schubert developed from the initial vintages onward, and while, at first, it was controversial, it soon became a marker of the Grange style. In this vintage, it begins to dissipate with air as the dynamic expanse of the wine emerges in layers of tannic intensity. What seemed bold though tightly compressed unwraps into a long, detailed flavor and a glorious explosion of green peppercorn spice. Still, mystically, it continues to feel refined and restrained. An intriguing vintage of Grange, one that will age on its stamina and sheer energy.","Based on fruit from Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Magill, and with 2% Cabernet seasoning to the Shiraz, the huge, brooding primary colour of youth is accompanied by the youthful primary black fruit, smokiness and sweet coconut and liquorice-spiced American oak (20 months in new hogsheads) that’s so typical of Grange. The richness and concentration of blackberry fruit opulence on the palate is inextricably bound up with a spice- and coconut-infused textural quality whose tannins, while big and bold, are surprisingly soft and sumptuous on the mid-palate. As the super-ripe blackberry and black cherry jam fruit subsides, the tannins kick in, along with a crispness ensuring that - in line with the Grange style generally - this heady wine will benefit from two decades of ageing.

Aromas of orange and lemon peel to start, then graphite, blackberries, plum paste, black cherries, boundless sweet oak spice, fresh cedar, tar, mahogany, roasted coffee and chocolate - the list goes on. Such complexity. Classic Grange, offering such deep, dark intensity. The palate has immense richness and depth with a super succulent and very long, fleshy, deeply weighted array of dense, velvet-wrapped tannins that run so long. The fruit flavors sit in the blackberry, blood-plum and blueberry zone with succulent, long and assertive structure, carrying through in an utterly seamless mode. The finish is tightly wrenched, in spectacularly powerful style, locking this wine in for a very long haul. Best from 2030.","The flagship 2015 Grange is a monster of wine and one of those rare wines that blends power and elegance perfectly. Revealing a saturated purple color, it’s seemingly more forward and seductive than past great vintages, which I suspect is due to the incredible purity of fruit as well as the wine’s flawless balance than any change in winemaking or stylistic shifts. I also think the acidity is healthy, and the 2015 tips the scales at 14.5% alcohol, which is certainly in the sweet spot, if not tame, for beautifully ripe Syrah these days. A blend of 98% Shiraz and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon that spent 20 months in new American oak hogsheads, it offers an extraordinary perfume of sweet crème de cassis, lead pencil shavings, camphor, Asian spices, licorice, and wildflowers. This is followed by a full-bodied, powerful yet incredibly seamless and elegant Shiraz that has no hard edges, a big, dense mid-palate, ripe tannins, and a great finish. Coming close to rivaling the 1986, which has always been a benchmark vintage of Grange for me, the 2015 offers a more polished, elegant, approachable style. Vintage comparisons aside, this is a legendary example of Grange in the making. The savvy wine lovers out there will give this 7-8 years of bottle age (I’ll probably be out of bottles by then) and enjoy over the following 2-3 decades.","The nose of the 2015 Grange features the wine's characteristic lifted aromas, joined by pronounced American oak influence and bold blackberry fruit, plus hints of red meat, raspberries, asphalt and vanilla. It's dense and concentrated on the palate, full-bodied yet balanced and firm, with a rich, velvety texture and long, plush finish. Don't expect great complexity at this stage—it's much too young to show much more than the primary fruit and oak elements—but this is a Grange that should easily go three or four decades.Rating: 98+","This vintage of the famed wine is perhaps its most approachable to date. The nose is open and expressive, with waves of aromas ranging from licorice, currant and plum to baking spice, furniture polish, freshly picked olive, mushroom and vanilla. The mouthfeel is satiny in texture, awash with fruit and spices of all shapes and sizes, all wound by fine tannins. Drink through 2040.","In 2015, the power, complexity and refinement of Grange hides behind its initial volatility. That’s part of the style Max Schubert developed from the initial vintages onward, and while, at first, it was controversial, it soon became a marker of the Grange style. In this vintage, it begins to dissipate with air as the dynamic expanse of the wine emerges in layers of tannic intensity. What seemed bold though tightly compressed unwraps into a long, detailed flavor and a glorious explosion of green peppercorn spice. Still, mystically, it continues to feel refined and restrained. An intriguing vintage of Grange, one that will age on its stamina and sheer energy.","Based on fruit from Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Magill, and with 2% Cabernet seasoning to the Shiraz, the huge, brooding primary colour of youth is accompanied by the youthful primary black fruit, smokiness and sweet coconut and liquorice-spiced American oak (20 months in new hogsheads) that’s so typical of Grange. The richness and concentration of blackberry fruit opulence on the palate is inextricably bound up with a spice- and coconut-infused textural quality whose tannins, while big and bold, are surprisingly soft and sumptuous on the mid-palate. As the super-ripe blackberry and black cherry jam fruit subsides, the tannins kick in, along with a crispness ensuring that - in line with the Grange style generally - this heady wine will benefit from two decades of ageing.

Aromas of orange and lemon peel to start, then graphite, blackberries, plum paste, black cherries, boundless sweet oak spice, fresh cedar, tar, mahogany, roasted coffee and chocolate - the list goes on. Such complexity. Classic Grange, offering such deep, dark intensity. The palate has immense richness and depth with a super succulent and very long, fleshy, deeply weighted array of dense, velvet-wrapped tannins that run so long. The fruit flavors sit in the blackberry, blood-plum and blueberry zone with succulent, long and assertive structure, carrying through in an utterly seamless mode. The finish is tightly wrenched, in spectacularly powerful style, locking this wine in for a very long haul. Best from 2030.","The flagship 2015 Grange is a monster of wine and one of those rare wines that blends power and elegance perfectly. Revealing a saturated purple color, it’s seemingly more forward and seductive than past great vintages, which I suspect is due to the incredible purity of fruit as well as the wine’s flawless balance than any change in winemaking or stylistic shifts. I also think the acidity is healthy, and the 2015 tips the scales at 14.5% alcohol, which is certainly in the sweet spot, if not tame, for beautifully ripe Syrah these days. A blend of 98% Shiraz and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon that spent 20 months in new American oak hogsheads, it offers an extraordinary perfume of sweet crème de cassis, lead pencil shavings, camphor, Asian spices, licorice, and wildflowers. This is followed by a full-bodied, powerful yet incredibly seamless and elegant Shiraz that has no hard edges, a big, dense mid-palate, ripe tannins, and a great finish. Coming close to rivaling the 1986, which has always been a benchmark vintage of Grange for me, the 2015 offers a more polished, elegant, approachable style. Vintage comparisons aside, this is a legendary example of Grange in the making. The savvy wine lovers out there will give this 7-8 years of bottle age (I’ll probably be out of bottles by then) and enjoy over the following 2-3 decades.","The nose of the 2015 Grange features the wine's characteristic lifted aromas, joined by pronounced American oak influence and bold blackberry fruit, plus hints of red meat, raspberries, asphalt and vanilla. It's dense and concentrated on the palate, full-bodied yet balanced and firm, with a rich, velvety texture and long, plush finish. Don't expect great complexity at this stage—it's much too young to show much more than the primary fruit and oak elements—but this is a Grange that should easily go three or four decades.Rating: 98+","This vintage of the famed wine is perhaps its most approachable to date. The nose is open and expressive, with waves of aromas ranging from licorice, currant and plum to baking spice, furniture polish, freshly picked olive, mushroom and vanilla. The mouthfeel is satiny in texture, awash with fruit and spices of all shapes and sizes, all wound by fine tannins. Drink through 2040.","In 2015, the power, complexity and refinement of Grange hides behind its initial volatility. That’s part of the style Max Schubert developed from the initial vintages onward, and while, at first, it was controversial, it soon became a marker of the Grange style. In this vintage, it begins to dissipate with air as the dynamic expanse of the wine emerges in layers of tannic intensity. What seemed bold though tightly compressed unwraps into a long, detailed flavor and a glorious explosion of green peppercorn spice. Still, mystically, it continues to feel refined and restrained. An intriguing vintage of Grange, one that will age on its stamina and sheer energy.","Based on fruit from Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Magill, and with 2% Cabernet seasoning to the Shiraz, the huge, brooding primary colour of youth is accompanied by the youthful primary black fruit, smokiness and sweet coconut and liquorice-spiced American oak (20 months in new hogsheads) that’s so typical of Grange. The richness and concentration of blackberry fruit opulence on the palate is inextricably bound up with a spice- and coconut-infused textural quality whose tannins, while big and bold, are surprisingly soft and sumptuous on the mid-palate. As the super-ripe blackberry and black cherry jam fruit subsides, the tannins kick in, along with a crispness ensuring that - in line with the Grange style generally - this heady wine will benefit from two decades of ageing.

A blend of 98% Shiraz and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon that spent 20 months in new American oak hogsheads, it offers an extraordinary perfume of sweet crème de cassis, lead pencil shavings, camphor, Asian spices, licorice, and wildflowers. This is followed by a full-bodied, powerful yet incredibly seamless and elegant Shiraz that has no hard edges, a big, dense mid-palate, ripe tannins, and a great finish. Coming close to rivaling the 1986, which has always been a benchmark vintage of Grange for me, the 2015 offers a more polished, elegant, approachable style. Vintage comparisons aside, this is a legendary example of Grange in the making. The savvy wine lovers out there will give this 7-8 years of bottle age (I’ll probably be out of bottles by then) and enjoy over the following 2-3 decades.","The nose of the 2015 Grange features the wine's characteristic lifted aromas, joined by pronounced American oak influence and bold blackberry fruit, plus hints of red meat, raspberries, asphalt and vanilla.

Aromas of orange and lemon peel to start, then graphite, blackberries, plum paste, black cherries, boundless sweet oak spice, fresh cedar, tar, mahogany, roasted coffee and chocolate - the list goes on. Such complexity. Classic Grange, offering such deep, dark intensity. The palate has immense richness and depth with a super succulent and very long, fleshy, deeply weighted array of dense, velvet-wrapped tannins that run so long. The fruit flavors sit in the blackberry, blood-plum and blueberry zone with succulent, long and assertive structure, carrying through in an utterly seamless mode. The finish is tightly wrenched, in spectacularly powerful style, locking this wine in for a very long haul.

Aromas of orange and lemon peel to start, then graphite, blackberries, plum paste, black cherries, boundless sweet oak spice, fresh cedar, tar, mahogany, roasted coffee and chocolate - the list goes on. Such complexity. Classic Grange, offering such deep, dark intensity. The palate has immense richness and depth with a super succulent and very long, fleshy, deeply weighted array of dense, velvet-wrapped tannins that run so long. The fruit flavors sit in the blackberry, blood-plum and blueberry zone with succulent, long and assertive structure, carrying through in an utterly seamless mode. The finish is tightly wrenched, in spectacularly powerful style, locking this wine in for a very long haul. Best from 2030.","The flagship 2015 Grange is a monster of wine and one of those rare wines that blends power and elegance perfectly. Revealing a saturated purple color, it’s seemingly more forward and seductive than past great vintages, which I suspect is due to the incredible purity of fruit as well as the wine’s flawless balance than any change in winemaking or stylistic shifts. I also think the acidity is healthy, and the 2015 tips the scales at 14.5% alcohol, which is certainly in the sweet spot, if not tame, for beautifully ripe Syrah these days. A blend of 98% Shiraz and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon that spent 20 months in new American oak hogsheads, it offers an extraordinary perfume of sweet crème de cassis, lead pencil shavings, camphor, Asian spices, licorice, and wildflowers. This is followed by a full-bodied, powerful yet incredibly seamless and elegant Shiraz that has no hard edges, a big, dense mid-palate, ripe tannins, and a great finish. Coming close to rivaling the 1986, which has always been a benchmark vintage of Grange for me, the 2015 offers a more polished, elegant, approachable style. Vintage comparisons aside, this is a legendary example of Grange in the making. The savvy wine lovers out there will give this 7-8 years of bottle age (I’ll probably be out of bottles by then) and enjoy over the following 2-3 decades.","The nose of the 2015 Grange features the wine's characteristic lifted aromas, joined by pronounced American oak influence and bold blackberry fruit, plus hints of red meat, raspberries, asphalt and vanilla. It's dense and concentrated on the palate, full-bodied yet balanced and firm, with a rich, velvety texture and long, plush finish. Don't expect great complexity at this stage—it's much too young to show much more than the primary fruit and oak elements—but this is a Grange that should easily go three or four decades.Rating: 98+","This vintage of the famed wine is perhaps its most approachable to date. The nose is open and expressive, with waves of aromas ranging from licorice, currant and plum to baking spice, furniture polish, freshly picked olive, mushroom and vanilla. The mouthfeel is satiny in texture, awash with fruit and spices of all shapes and sizes, all wound by fine tannins. Drink through 2040.","In 2015, the power, complexity and refinement of Grange hides behind its initial volatility. That’s part of the style Max Schubert developed from the initial vintages onward, and while, at first, it was controversial, it soon became a marker of the Grange style. In this vintage, it begins to dissipate with air as the dynamic expanse of the wine emerges in layers of tannic intensity. What seemed bold though tightly compressed unwraps into a long, detailed flavor and a glorious explosion of green peppercorn spice. Still, mystically, it continues to feel refined and restrained. An intriguing vintage of Grange, one that will age on its stamina and sheer energy.","Based on fruit from Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Magill, and with 2% Cabernet seasoning to the Shiraz, the huge, brooding primary colour of youth is accompanied by the youthful primary black fruit, smokiness and sweet coconut and liquorice-spiced American oak (20 months in new hogsheads) that’s so typical of Grange. The richness and concentration of blackberry fruit opulence on the palate is inextricably bound up with a spice- and coconut-infused textural quality whose tannins, while big and bold, are surprisingly soft and sumptuous on the mid-palate. As the super-ripe blackberry and black cherry jam fruit subsides, the tannins kick in, along with a crispness ensuring that - in line with the Grange style generally - this heady wine will benefit from two decades of ageing.

Aromas of orange and lemon peel to start, then graphite, blackberries, plum paste, black cherries, boundless sweet oak spice, fresh cedar, tar, mahogany, roasted coffee and chocolate - the list goes on. Such complexity. Classic Grange, offering such deep, dark intensity. The palate has immense richness and depth with a super succulent and very long, fleshy, deeply weighted array of dense, velvet-wrapped tannins that run so long.

The finish is tightly wrenched, in spectacularly powerful style, locking this wine in for a very long haul. Best from 2030.","The flagship 2015 Grange is a monster of wine and one of those rare wines that blends power and elegance perfectly. Revealing a saturated purple color, it’s seemingly more forward and seductive than past great vintages, which I suspect is due to the incredible purity of fruit as well as the wine’s flawless balance than any change in winemaking or stylistic shifts. I also think the acidity is healthy, and the 2015 tips the scales at 14.5% alcohol, which is certainly in the sweet spot, if not tame, for beautifully ripe Syrah these days. A blend of 98% Shiraz and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon that spent 20 months in new American oak hogsheads, it offers an extraordinary perfume of sweet crème de cassis, lead pencil shavings, camphor, Asian spices, licorice, and wildflowers. This is followed by a full-bodied, powerful yet incredibly seamless and elegant Shiraz that has no hard edges, a big, dense mid-palate, ripe tannins, and a great finish. Coming close to rivaling the 1986, which has always been a benchmark vintage of Grange for me, the 2015 offers a more polished, elegant, approachable style. Vintage comparisons aside, this is a legendary example of Grange in the making. The savvy wine lovers out there will give this 7-8 years of bottle age (I’ll probably be out of bottles by then) and enjoy over the following 2-3 decades.","The nose of the 2015 Grange features the wine's characteristic lifted aromas, joined by pronounced American oak influence and bold blackberry fruit, plus hints of red meat, raspberries, asphalt and vanilla. It's dense and concentrated on the palate, full-bodied yet balanced and firm, with a rich, velvety texture and long, plush finish. Don't expect great complexity at this stage—it's much too young to show much more than the primary fruit and oak elements—but this is a Grange that should easily go three or four decades.Rating: 98+","This vintage of the famed wine is perhaps its most approachable to date. The nose is open and expressive, with waves of aromas ranging from licorice, currant and plum to baking spice, furniture polish, freshly picked olive, mushroom and vanilla. The mouthfeel is satiny in texture, awash with fruit and spices of all shapes and sizes, all wound by fine tannins. Drink through 2040.","In 2015, the power, complexity and refinement of Grange hides behind its initial volatility. That’s part of the style Max Schubert developed from the initial vintages onward, and while, at first, it was controversial, it soon became a marker of the Grange style. In this vintage, it begins to dissipate with air as the dynamic expanse of the wine emerges in layers of tannic intensity. What seemed bold though tightly compressed unwraps into a long, detailed flavor and a glorious explosion of green peppercorn spice. Still, mystically, it continues to feel refined and restrained. An intriguing vintage of Grange, one that will age on its stamina and sheer energy.","Based on fruit from Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Magill, and with 2% Cabernet seasoning to the Shiraz, the huge, brooding primary colour of youth is accompanied by the youthful primary black fruit, smokiness and sweet coconut and liquorice-spiced American oak (20 months in new hogsheads) that’s so typical of Grange. The richness and concentration of blackberry fruit opulence on the palate is inextricably bound up with a spice- and coconut-infused textural quality whose tannins, while big and bold, are surprisingly soft and sumptuous on the mid-palate. As the super-ripe blackberry and black cherry jam fruit subsides, the tannins kick in, along with a crispness ensuring that - in line with the Grange style generally - this heady wine will benefit from two decades of ageing.

Such complexity. Classic Grange, offering such deep, dark intensity. The palate has immense richness and depth with a super succulent and very long, fleshy, deeply weighted array of dense, velvet-wrapped tannins that run so long.

The finish is tightly wrenched, in spectacularly powerful style, locking this wine in for a very long haul. Best from 2030.","The flagship 2015 Grange is a monster of wine and one of those rare wines that blends power and elegance perfectly. Revealing a saturated purple color, it’s seemingly more forward and seductive than past great vintages, which I suspect is due to the incredible purity of fruit as well as the wine’s flawless balance than any change in winemaking or stylistic shifts. I also think the acidity is healthy, and the 2015 tips the scales at 14.5% alcohol, which is certainly in the sweet spot, if not tame, for beautifully ripe Syrah these days. A blend of 98% Shiraz and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon that spent 20 months in new American oak hogsheads, it offers an extraordinary perfume of sweet crème de cassis, lead pencil shavings, camphor, Asian spices, licorice, and wildflowers. This is followed by a full-bodied, powerful yet incredibly seamless and elegant Shiraz that has no hard edges, a big, dense mid-palate, ripe tannins, and a great finish. Coming close to rivaling the 1986, which has always been a benchmark vintage of Grange for me, the 2015 offers a more polished, elegant, approachable style. Vintage comparisons aside, this is a legendary example of Grange in the making. The savvy wine lovers out there will give this 7-8 years of bottle age (I’ll probably be out of bottles by then) and enjoy over the following 2-3 decades.","The nose of the 2015 Grange features the wine's characteristic lifted aromas, joined by pronounced American oak influence and bold blackberry fruit, plus hints of red meat, raspberries, asphalt and vanilla. It's dense and concentrated on the palate, full-bodied yet balanced and firm, with a rich, velvety texture and long, plush finish. Don't expect great complexity at this stage—it's much too young to show much more than the primary fruit and oak elements—but this is a Grange that should easily go three or four decades.Rating: 98+","This vintage of the famed wine is perhaps its most approachable to date. The nose is open and expressive, with waves of aromas ranging from licorice, currant and plum to baking spice, furniture polish, freshly picked olive, mushroom and vanilla. The mouthfeel is satiny in texture, awash with fruit and spices of all shapes and sizes, all wound by fine tannins. Drink through 2040.","In 2015, the power, complexity and refinement of Grange hides behind its initial volatility. That’s part of the style Max Schubert developed from the initial vintages onward, and while, at first, it was controversial, it soon became a marker of the Grange style. In this vintage, it begins to dissipate with air as the dynamic expanse of the wine emerges in layers of tannic intensity. What seemed bold though tightly compressed unwraps into a long, detailed flavor and a glorious explosion of green peppercorn spice. Still, mystically, it continues to feel refined and restrained. An intriguing vintage of Grange, one that will age on its stamina and sheer energy.","Based on fruit from Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Magill, and with 2% Cabernet seasoning to the Shiraz, the huge, brooding primary colour of youth is accompanied by the youthful primary black fruit, smokiness and sweet coconut and liquorice-spiced American oak (20 months in new hogsheads) that’s so typical of Grange. The richness and concentration of blackberry fruit opulence on the palate is inextricably bound up with a spice- and coconut-infused textural quality whose tannins, while big and bold, are surprisingly soft and sumptuous on the mid-palate. As the super-ripe blackberry and black cherry jam fruit subsides, the tannins kick in, along with a crispness ensuring that - in line with the Grange style generally - this heady wine will benefit from two decades of ageing.

An intriguing vintage of Grange, one that will age on its stamina and sheer energy.","Based on fruit from Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Magill, and with 2% Cabernet seasoning to the Shiraz, the huge, brooding primary colour of youth is accompanied by the youthful primary black fruit, smokiness and sweet coconut and liquorice-spiced American oak (20 months in new hogsheads) that’s so typical of Grange. The richness and concentration of blackberry fruit opulence on the palate is inextricably bound up with a spice- and coconut-infused textural quality whose tannins, while big and bold, are surprisingly soft and sumptuous on the mid-palate. As the super-ripe blackberry and black cherry jam fruit subsides, the tannins kick in, along with a crispness ensuring that - in line with the Grange style generally - this heady wine will benefit from two decades of ageing.

It was produced with grapes from cooler vineyards that enjoyed 20 extra days of slow ripening compared with warmer zones, which provided them with perfect ripeness and deep flavors. This blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacha and the remaining 10% between Mazuelo and Graciano had an extended élevage, in this case no less than three years (alternating newer and older barrels). This is still a baby and I know Winemaker Jorge Muga would like to keep it in bottle for longer before selling it, but the commercial pressure is tremendous, as there has been no wine since 2006. The wine has 14.1% alcohol and a surprising 3.34 pH, especially considering 2009 was generally a warm and ripe year. But somehow this cuvée seems to work very well in ripe vintages. The wine feels even younger on the palate, and it still needs to develop some further complexity and the silky texture for which this wine is famous. There is good balance here and all the elements are in place for a nice development in bottle. In fact, it feels like one of the great recent vintages of Prado Enea. There will be no Prado Enea in 2012 and 2013 either, but it's produced in 2010, 2014 (small quantities) and 2015. At this quality level, the price seems like a real bargain. 90,000 bottles produced in 2009.","This shows the ripeness and intensity of the vintage with truffles and hints of tea. Full body, layered and beautiful. Flavorful finish.","Alluring, complex and powerful aromas of grilled meat, berries, tea, smoke, vanilla and spice cover every base.

It was produced with grapes from cooler vineyards that enjoyed 20 extra days of slow ripening compared with warmer zones, which provided them with perfect ripeness and deep flavors. This blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacha and the remaining 10% between Mazuelo and Graciano had an extended élevage, in this case no less than three years (alternating newer and older barrels). This is still a baby and I know Winemaker Jorge Muga would like to keep it in bottle for longer before selling it, but the commercial pressure is tremendous, as there has been no wine since 2006. The wine has 14.1% alcohol and a surprising 3.34 pH, especially considering 2009 was generally a warm and ripe year. But somehow this cuvée seems to work very well in ripe vintages. The wine feels even younger on the palate, and it still needs to develop some further complexity and the silky texture for which this wine is famous. There is good balance here and all the elements are in place for a nice development in bottle. In fact, it feels like one of the great recent vintages of Prado Enea. There will be no Prado Enea in 2012 and 2013 either, but it's produced in 2010, 2014 (small quantities) and 2015. At this quality level, the price seems like a real bargain. 90,000 bottles produced in 2009.","This shows the ripeness and intensity of the vintage with truffles and hints of tea.

Shows lots of potential.Range: 94-95","Because of very low yields and a warm and dry season, the 2017 Flor de Pingus was produced from very concentrated grapes with lots of tannin, so they had to do a very soft vinification and an extended élevage, being very careful not to dry out the wine. So, they used less new oak barrels, and the wine was alternatively in barrique and stainless steel, trying to polish the tannins and keep the juiciness and avoid excessive tannins. So, the wine is polished, more than it usually is. It's ripe but without the perfect ripeness of a great vintage. It has character, in a somehow more baroque way. Peter Sisseck compared it to other vintages finished in seven: 1997, 2007. They only produced some 60,000 bottles, when the normal production should have been around 100,000 bottles, which means they lost some 40% of the crop because of the frost. It was bottled in July 2019, later than in other vintages.","A youthful 2017 that’s both bright and rich, Flor de Pingus is a selection from vineyards around the town of La Horra.

Shows lots of potential.Range: 94-95","Because of very low yields and a warm and dry season, the 2017 Flor de Pingus was produced from very concentrated grapes with lots of tannin, so they had to do a very soft vinification and an extended élevage, being very careful not to dry out the wine. So, they used less new oak barrels, and the wine was alternatively in barrique and stainless steel, trying to polish the tannins and keep the juiciness and avoid excessive tannins. So, the wine is polished, more than it usually is. It's ripe but without the perfect ripeness of a great vintage. It has character, in a somehow more baroque way. Peter Sisseck compared it to other vintages finished in seven: 1997, 2007. They only produced some 60,000 bottles, when the normal production should have been around 100,000 bottles, which means they lost some 40% of the crop because of the frost. It was bottled in July 2019, later than in other vintages.","A youthful 2017 that’s both bright and rich, Flor de Pingus is a selection from vineyards around the town of La Horra.

In 2007, they put a windmill in one of the plots, and although the plot was not able to escape the frost, it was not as acute as it was in the Flor de Pingus vineyards, where they lost up to 40% of the crop. At the Pingus vineyards, they lost some 25% of the grapes. They started the élevage in used barriques, where they wine matured for 12 months, and then moved the wine to larger barrels so they could extend the aging. There are alternate sensations of ripeness and herbal aromas. You can see a little bit of the tannic style of a concentrated year (1995, 2004, 2014), which is very different from fluid years like 2016 or 1996, with a rustic Ribera character. They saved the vintage with their knowledge of their vineyards, whereas in the past, a vintage like this could have been a disaster.

In 2007, they put a windmill in one of the plots, and although the plot was not able to escape the frost, it was not as acute as it was in the Flor de Pingus vineyards, where they lost up to 40% of the crop. At the Pingus vineyards, they lost some 25% of the grapes. They started the élevage in used barriques, where they wine matured for 12 months, and then moved the wine to larger barrels so they could extend the aging. There are alternate sensations of ripeness and herbal aromas. You can see a little bit of the tannic style of a concentrated year (1995, 2004, 2014), which is very different from fluid years like 2016 or 1996, with a rustic Ribera character.

In 2007, they put a windmill in one of the plots, and although the plot was not able to escape the frost, it was not as acute as it was in the Flor de Pingus vineyards, where they lost up to 40% of the crop. At the Pingus vineyards, they lost some 25% of the grapes. They started the élevage in used barriques, where they wine matured for 12 months, and then moved the wine to larger barrels so they could extend the aging. There are alternate sensations of ripeness and herbal aromas. You can see a little bit of the tannic style of a concentrated year (1995, 2004, 2014), which is very different from fluid years like 2016 or 1996, with a rustic Ribera character. They saved the vintage with their knowledge of their vineyards, whereas in the past, a vintage like this could have been a disaster. Sometimes wines like this can have an unexpected development in bottle... 5,700 bottles were filled in July 2019."],"price":"$34.99","color":"no data, see reviews","colorIntensity":"no data, see

It is a phenomenal blend of 55% Cariñena and 45% Garnacha from very old vines planted on schist (llicorella) slopes in the village of Poboleda. Dark, almost opaque with a bright border, the nose is more about black fruit, peat, graphite and some shoe polish, with a generous dose of oak, a little raw (from youth) but with harmony and huge potential to develop. The bunches are hand-harvested and the grapes selected one by one in a double sorting table and fermented in stainless steel. The wine matured in new French oak barriques for 16 months, in a straightforward process, because what's important here is the quality of the grapes, mostly from centenary vines. There is great harmony in the palate, too, intense and penetrating without being aggressive, elegant and balanced in an XXL way. I see great freshness in these 2013s, one of the best vintages I've tried from Mas Doix. This should age forever. Rating:95+","The first impression this wine gives is of an oak curtain that hides the fruit. Slowly, it fades to show the true face of this old-vine blend of cariñena and garnacha: intense red fruits and herbs, with a heart of slate sustaining mineral tannins in the background.

The heat of the vintage has put plenty of flesh on the bones, \ncomplementing the savoury, spicy elegance. The tannins and acidity add balance and \nrefinement. What a wine! 2025-40","Marqués de Murrieta didn't produce their top red in 2008, so I tasted the 2009 Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial. In 2009, the final blend was Tempranillo with 19% Mazuelo (or Cariñena), one of the highest percentages of Mazuelo ever. The grapes are now sourced from the La Plana vineyard within the Ygay estate, one of the higher-altitude plots at 485 meters. The grapes fermented and aged separately, the Tempranillo in American oak barrels and the Mazuelo in French barriques for 26 months, given its power. It has that seriousness, character and somehow rusticity of the Mazuelo, austere, harmonious and still young. It has good depth and concentration, still young and lively with fine tannins and a backbone of freshness that lifts it up. It will develop for a very long time in bottle. This is a great classical Rioja for the long haul. 109,000 bottles and some larger formats were produced. It was bottled in October 2014. The prices are increasing but so is the quality. The following vintages will be 2010, 2011 and possibly 2012. I cannot wait to taste them...","The vines on the La Plana plateau, the highest point of the estate, at 1,600 feet in elevation, were 60 years old when faced with the heat of the 2009 vintage. The majority of this wine is tempranillo, harvested at the end of September; 19 percent of the blend is mazuelo (carignan), harvested a week later. The wine has the richness of the vintage while the fruit holds its freshness, with tart plum and strawberry notes helping to shape all the flavor concentration. It’s a fat wine with attitude, packing dense tannins that last for minutes and need a decade or more to be fully absorbed into the fruit. It’s supple, heady and delicious now, and significantly more complex with several days of air, as it will be with years of age.","A special Rioja that’s traditional, but not old-fashioned. Dusty, licorice and spice nose with red fruit. A cool and elegant wine, in spite of the concentration. Long, firm finish. Expands with aeration. From vines planted in 1945. Drink or hold.","2009 was a warm year, a good vintage to increase the Mazuelo component (up to 19%) in order to ensure balancing acidity next to the rich dark fruit. This has been successfully rendered, the tannins hitherto tight and fairly chalky, but the structure warm and embracing. Cassis and blackberry dominate the fruit profile, then black pepper, cloves and even a hint of cinnamon providing a spicy backdrop. The finish is powerful but does not want for elegance.","Black cherry, plum, clove, cocoa and mineral flavors are rich and harmonious in this polished red. Well-integrated tannins and balsamic acidity keep this balanced. Shows focus and depth, but remains very fresh. Tempranillo and Mazuelo.

An extremely complex and elegant wine. Rich and multifarious, the nose is a sophisticated palette of aromas. Fresh raspberries, blackberries, black currants and other berry fruits enhance floral notes of violets and rose petals. Also present are hints of black pepper and toasted almonds that evolve into sweet spices such as cardamom and vanilla. Notes of truffles and a delicate minerality showcase the Toro terroir.

It was an extremely dry year, even if the end of the season was not particularly warm, but the wines are a little more concentrated. It felt fresher than the 2011, pretty balsamic and minty, but with notes of Mediterranean herbs too. The palate is neatly balanced, and there is no alcohol or heat to be found.

The wine might be a tad lighter than other vintages, but it's more structured than 2008; it combines elegance and power, is nicely balanced and should be able to develop in bottle for many years, although the quick evolution of the bottle once opened made me hesitate about its drinking window. Let's hope I'm wrong. 80,000 bottles produced.","This harmonious red is balanced and deep, offering ripe plum and currant flavors, with black pepper, tobacco, licorice and mineral accents. Delivers plenty of structure, with well-integrated tannins and lively acidity. The wine remains graceful through the long, spicy finish. Drink now through 2027.","Aromas of raisin and cassis lean in the direction of overripe. This is less elegant and more blocky than most bottlings of Unico, but with ripe, loamy blackberry and plum flavors, it tastes great. A slightly hollow but round finish with mild residual tannins suggests that this be drunk now through 2024."],"price":"$160.02","color":"no data, see reviews","colorIntensity":"no data, see

The wine might be a tad lighter than other vintages, but it's more structured than 2008; it combines elegance and power, is nicely balanced and should be able to develop in bottle for many years, although the quick evolution of the bottle once opened made me hesitate about its drinking window. Let's hope I'm wrong. 80,000 bottles produced.","This harmonious red is balanced and deep, offering ripe plum and currant flavors, with black pepper, tobacco, licorice and mineral accents.

Drink now through 2027.","Aromas of raisin and cassis lean in the direction of overripe.

The wine keep getting better and better as it aerated. The exotic and super-rich 2008 Concha y Toro Carmin de Peumo Carmenere dances onto the palate in a way that few ultra-rich wines can; shows blueberries and raspberries on the palate; the wine's silkiness is just amazing.

The palate is medium-bodied, smooth and velvety in texture with finely tuned acidity, nicely poised and gently fanning out with a fresh blackberry and bilberry finish, white pepper and clove lingering on the aftertaste. This is one of the most refined vintages of Series C that I have tasted.","A very impressive wine that shows cassis, preserved plums, tar and hints of eucalyptus and cloves. The palate's full and packed in with all-encompassing tannins and a long, complex finish. A blend of cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc.

Deep in color, in my opinion it has a superior bouquet compared to the Series M this vintage: very well defined with gorgeous black cherry and blueberry fruit, the oak seamlessly integrated even though it will need 3-4 years to fully integrate. The palate is medium-bodied, smooth and velvety in texture with finely tuned acidity, nicely poised and gently fanning out with a fresh blackberry and bilberry finish, white pepper and clove lingering on the aftertaste. This is one of the most refined vintages of Series C that I have tasted.","A very impressive wine that shows cassis, preserved plums, tar and hints of eucalyptus and cloves. The palate's full and packed in with all-encompassing tannins and a long, complex finish. A blend of cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc.

In fact, the 2018, based on grapes picked at 103° Oechsle and bottled with 9.3% alcohol and 65 grams of residual sugar, is so clear, precise and fresh as well as flinty, like the generic Spätlese but with so much more intensity and concentration. On the palate, this Gräfenberg Spätlese is lush but enormously precise, piquant and firm, very elegant and complex, with fascinating acidity and phenolic as well as mineral grip and tension. A fascinating wine and one of the finest Spätlese in Germany from the 2018 vintage. So mouthwatering and stimulating due to a low pH level and 10 grams of total acidity. However, Weil says the freshness is thanks to the \"Bernsteinsäure\" that characterizes many of the 2018s.","Gräfenberg, a steep, sheltered, south-facing site, lives up to its grand-cru status in this Spätlese. As with all of Weil’s vineyards, it’s farmed with minimum inputs and picked by hand with an army of workers; that allows for numerous passes through the vineyards to catch the grapes at their ultimate moment of ripeness, and before botrytis has set in. The wine fermented entirely in stainless-steel tanks, and the flavors sing: It tastes of sweet herbs and ripe peaches, citrus fruit and wildflower honey. Despite the sweetness, the wine ends clean, with an energy and tension from its powerful acidity. Gorgeous now, this will age well.","This white shows a little bit of reduction at the beginning, adding charm, while lemon paste, coriander and clementine notes follow. The acidity is slightly ciderlike, but is well-integrated into the wine, giving this an edgy profile. Intriguing and long. Give this time. Best from 2023 through 2035. 650 cases made."],"price":"$439","color":"no data, see reviews","colorIntensity":"no data, see reviews","noseIntensity":"no data","noseDevelopment":"no data","body":"no data, see structure","quality":"no data, see scores","tertiaryFlavors":"combined with secondary","aromaIntensity":"no data, see reviews","primaryAromas":"no data, see flavor","secondaryAromas":"no data, see flavor","tertiaryAromas":"no data, see flavor","ageing":"no data, cellar-tracker?","balance":"no data, see reviews","length":"no data, see reviews","finish":"no data, see reviews","intensity":"pronounced","complexity":"no data, see reviews","conclusion":"no data, see professional reviews"}]
