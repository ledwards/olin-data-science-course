128685,"Italy","Bertani keeps a library of vintages that remain available. This 2000 is absolutely gorgeous, with exotic spice, clove, milled pepper, black fruit, dried apple skin, tobacco and cola. The complexity is extraordinary and so is the smoothness and quality of its fine tannins.

128686,"Italy","Serra della Contessa (named after Benanti's most beautiful and historic vineyard) is an important wine in the history of Etna winemaking because it was among the first to show the massive potential of this dramatic terrain. This wine is executed in a richer, more opulent style with excellent complexity and endurance, capped by bright aromas of spice, forest berry and light smoke nuances.","Serra della Contessa",94,49,"Sicily & Sardinia","Etna","","","","Benanti 2005 Serra della Contessa  (Etna)","Red Blend","Benanti",15297,1495453
128687,"US","Mostly old vine fruit creates the exceptional Cabernet, which also includes small amounts of the other four Bordeaux grapes in the blend. The lovely bouquet is now starting to develop some secondary aromatics, expressive and complex. Delicious raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, crisply defined by firm acids, are nudged into hedonism with a wash of pretty chocolate and buttery nuts.","",94,75,"Washington","Columbia Valley (WA)","Columbia Valley","Paul Gregutt","@paulgwine ","Corliss Estates 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))","Cabernet Sauvignon","Corliss Estates",1772137,3049476

128689,"France","Each year, the Jacquesson blended nonvintage is identified by a new cuvée number, meaning the vintage basis of the blend and the composition has changed. But not the style, which remains firmly dry, full of gravitas and intense quality. The wine has plenty of freshness, but the ripe fruit shows signs of opening out and becoming more complex.","Cuvée No 733 Brut",94,63,"Champagne","Champagne","","Roger Voss","@vossroger","Jacquesson et Fils NV Cuvée No 733 Brut  (Champagne)","Champagne Blend","Jacquesson et Fils",,

Dry and complex in mountain tannins, the wine displays massively deep flavors of blackberries and cassis, and the new oak is substantial and sweet.

128694,"US","A very beautiful, intricate and complex Cabernet, but one that needs time in the cellar. The balance is beyond question. The heart of black currants subtlely tinged with mushu plum sauce and tar, is delicious. The oak is smoky and fine. But the tannins are fierce.

128695,"France","A beautifully fine, elegant wine, the acidity like a shaft of light through the tight apple and grapefruit flavors. The texture is taut, steely, with vivid tannins.

It's brilliantly structured, with a core of black cherries, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates, mushrooms and spices, with rich notes of smoke, cocoa and cedar.
