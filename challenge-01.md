*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

**q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this
dataset?

``` r
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female"…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", …
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, …

**Observations**:

Class, Sex, Age, Survived, n

**q2** Skim the [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic,
and look for a total count of passengers. Compare against the total
computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large
or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

Wikipedia lists two possible numbers for the number of people onboard
the Titanic: “3,327 (or 3,547 according to other sources),” but crew
specifically as 2,435. The fact that there are conflicting figures for
the number of total people on the ship suggests there is some
conflicting information in the historical record that might account for
the disparity between passenger compliment. Maybe some counts included
stowaways, or others included people who bought a ticket but didn’t show
up.

**q3** Create a plot showing the count of passengers who *did* survive,
along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations
below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  count(Sex, Class) %>%
  
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex), position = "dodge")
```

    ## Using `n` as weighting variable
    ## ℹ Quiet this message with `wt = n` or count rows with `wt = 1`

![](challenge-01_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

Total number of survivors among First and Second Classes seem to be
skewed toward women, where among Third Class, it is more equal. The
total number of survivors in First is greater than in Second, which is
greater than in Third. A much larger numbe rof crew was aved overall,
but mostly men, and few women. But we don’t know much about the relative
sizes of these categories.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 x 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

**q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of
`n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations
you make in comparison with q3.

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%

  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex), position = "dodge")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_col).

![](challenge-01_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

Proportionally, it looks like more First and Second Class passengers
survived. In Third Class and Crew, proportionally far did. Among those
two groups, more women were saved than men (proportionally.)

**q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of passengers who
*did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`.
Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables\!

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%

  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex), position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ Age)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_col).

![](challenge-01_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

Taking children into account, it’s clear that many of the surviving men
were children. It still seems to be true that lower classes made up a
small proportion of survivors. Sadly, this was even true for children,
and for women.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
